= Overview =
[[Image:Character_Minstrel.jpg|thumb|200px|Official Maestro Illustration]]

Maestro is one of must-have support class on any instance run. having maestro on your party is tricky, because your team should play around the bard instead of their personal build. Lots of class will become overpowered with the help of experienced maestro, while other won't noticed any single difference. The key to get full benefit of maestro, is always look for your ability which only has Cast delay instead of cooldown (e.g for Ranger, it's best to use aimed bolt instead of arrow storm or auto-attack because they could spam them for huge DPS).

Playing as a Maestro isn't that hard. you just need to know your positioning, switching your skills, knows what buff you should give, and getting that sweet 150 INT and 150 DEX. In this guide, I'll give out my personal build to barding. You won't be able to survive soloing, but you'll become great asset on instance run or MVP hunting. I also going to give a little bit of tips on how to leveling Maestro on it's early stage.

= Before Getting Started =
I want to put this section for non-Maestro player who might read this guide. Please do this if you play with Maestro
* Don't scatter away. Try to stack near Maestro so it's easier to buff everyone with song combo.
* Always use your spam skill when fighting MVP while buffed by bragi.
* You don't have to always stay on Bard's song. It'll give you 20 second buff so you just need to re-enter here and then.

= Stats =
the stats I listed down below is what stat you should aim including bonus (eg if I stated 100 VIT, you can achieve it by 93 base VIT + 7 job bonus). These stats are just bare minimum, so you can adjust them as you like. I'll arrange the stats by the most important to most useless stats.

*'''Intelligence ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats#INT INT])'''
INT is primarily used for [[File:Bd_bragi.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Magic_Strings '''Poem of Bragi'''] and helps with SP pool and regeneration. INT affect '''After-cast delay''' reduction and capped at 150 INT which reduced to 100% &lt;strike>'''(Skill spam FTW!!)'''&lt;/strike>. This is the '''most''' crucial stats of your job. No matter what, you '''SHOULD''' have 150 total INT. You can easily achieve this by put 125 base INT and buffed by [[File:Clementia.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Clementia '''Clementia'''] (125 base + 9 bonus job + 16 Clementia = GG). You can get your own 150 INT without Clementia with gearing which I'll talk about later
*'''Dexternity ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats#DEX DEX])'''
Dex is equally imporant as INT because it'll reduce '''Variable cast time''' through [[File:Bd_bragi.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Magic_Strings '''Poem of Bragi''']. You should aim as much as you can as long as it's '''multiple by 10'''. Be sure to always use [[File:Improve_Concentration.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Improve_concentration '''Improve Concentration'''] to get easy DEX bonus. You should at least get total 140 DEX to help other caster achieved [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#Cast_Time '''Insta-cast''']
*'''Vitality ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats#VIT VIT])'''
100 total VIT is a must, no matter what class you are. it's purely for stun immunity and increasing your Max HP. You can add this stat so you won't get 1-shotted by mob, especially things like [[File:NPC_Skill_Icon.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Earthquake '''Earthquake'''] and [[File:NPC_Skill_Icon.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Judgement '''Hell's Judgment''']. This stats also boost [[File:Song_of_Lutie.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Song_of_Lutie '''Apple of Idun'''] Max HP per 10 VIT and HP regeneration per 2 VIT
*'''Agility ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats#AGI AGI])'''
It used to increase your flee just in case you're out of formation and get hit by mob. This stats also boost [[File:Impressive_Riff.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Impressive_Riff '''Assassin Cross on Sunset'''] ASPD per 10 AGI. Personally I'll aim 90 AGI to help other melee player getting 193 ASPD through Assassin Cross on Sunset. It also reduce your casting animation delay, but I'm not quite sure how it works. It also increase [[File:Perfect_Tablature.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Perfect_Tablature '''Whistle'''] flee rate per 10 AGI
*'''Luck ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats#LUK LUK])'''
LUK is used purely for perfect dodge and stone curse resist. I usually put rest of point here. It increase [[File:Perfect_Tablature.png|frameless|24x24px]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Perfect_Tablature '''Whistle'''] perfect dodge per 10 LUK.
*'''Strength ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats#STR STR])'''
You just need this stats for increasing weight limit. You can safely put 1 STR and live your happy life unless you want to help your party member to carry some equipments or potions. Note that you need to bring at least {{Item List |id=6144|item=Regrettable Tears |num=60 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=610 |item=Yggdrasil Leaf |num=5 |simple=yes}} at all time. You can bring more items but you should have those item at disposal

|-
|[[File:Song of Lutie.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Song_of_Lutie '''Apple of Idun''']
|10
|Increase MaxHP and heal everyone inside per 6 second. This skill is every priest nightmare because everyone suddenly has their MaxHP boosted while its current HP stay as is. If you decided to buff someone with it, remember to reapply the skill before the buff gone.
|-

|8-10
|It adds flee and perfect dodge. You might rarely use this skill, but pretty helpful for tanker.
|-
|[[File:Bd_bragi.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Magic_Strings '''A Poem of Bragi''']
|10
|Your signature skill. This is the sole reason why Maestro > Wanderer and the sole reason why bard is extremely useful. People will ask bragi and you need to keep the buff up every single time. Be sure to check who actually need bragi instead of randomly spam bragi to everyone. For people who aren't bard, please stick with the pard if you need this buff because its hard to keep up with everyone since our movement speed decreased so bad when singing. '''Do note that you only need 150 INT including bonus from gear and buff! More than that is waste of point. Put rest of them to your DEX'''

If you still want to hit something :

|-
|[[File:Arrow_Vulcan.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Arrow_Vulcan '''Arrow Vulcan''']
|10
|Finally a real damage skill for bard. Use this skill until you got bored and decided to choose the singing path
|-
|[[File:Tarot_Card_of_Fate.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tarot_Card_of_Fate '''Tarot Card of Fate''']
|3-5

|-
|[[File:Acoustic_Rhythm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Acoustic_Rhythm '''Invulnerable Siegfried''']
|5
|80% all element resist. All magic will tickle your team mate and extremely helpful for boss who always spam magic skill (such as {{monster|id=2320 Bakonawa}})
|-
|[[File:Battle_Theme.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Battle_Theme '''A Drum on the Battlefield''']
|5
|Increase ATK by 250 and DEF by 50. I'm not quite sure if its boost Hard DEF or Soft DEF. Either way, 250 bonus ATK is damn great
|-
|[[File:Harmonic_Lick.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Harmonic_Lick '''The Ring of Nibelungen''']
|3
|Increase ATK by 125 and gives DEF-piercing attribute. It only works on anyone who equips Lv 4 weapon. Unfortunately we can't get lv 5 song without sacrificing maestro skill point. FYI it adds 175 ATK on level 5.
|}

=== Third Job Skills ===
I only list most used skill and few optional skill on the list. Be sure to read down below on how to use Maestro's buff
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!style=" width: 20%" |Skill
!Level
!Notes
|-
|[[File:Voice_Lessons.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Voice_Lessons '''Voice Lessons''']
|10
|Increase your max SP and SP Regeneration. SP Regen effect only applies if you didn't move for 10 seconds. You can cast skill as long as you're not moving. It also boost lots of skill ability.
|-
|[[File:Windmill_Rush.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Windmill_Rush '''Windmill Rush''']
|5
|At level 5, it'll boost 30 + Voice_Lessons_Lv + (JobLv ÷ 5), thus makes them add 52 ATK at max job level. This is your primary buff and you should reapply them whenever the effect almost gone.
|-
|[[File:Frigg%27s_Song.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Frigg%27s_Song '''Frigg's Song''']
|5
|Another great buff which increase all party member MaxHP by 25%. It requires {{Item List |id=6144|item=Regrettable Tears |num=1 |simple=yes}} per cast. Just like '''Apple of Idun''', you should reapply them before the skill runs out so the priest wont freaked out.
|-
|[[File:Gloomy_Shyness.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gloomy_Shyness '''Gloomy Shyness''']
|5
|It buffs certain knight and crusader skills, but the real use is the debuff for enemy. It reduce 45 flee and 40% ASPD and works with boss. You should always apply this to MVP and other annoying high-flee or high-ASPD enemy. Be sure to carefully target your enemy because if you hit your non-swordsman allies with this, their flee will be reduced too.
|-
|[[File:Dances_with_Wargs.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wargs '''Dances with Wargs''']
|5
|Extremely great buff which increase [http://irowiki.org/wiki/ATK#Equipment_ATK '''Equip ATK'''], ASPD, Fixed Cast Time, and certain Ranger's Warg skills. You need other performer to cast this song, Bard or Dancer is fine either way
|-
|[[File:Song_of_Mana.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Song_of_Mana '''Song of Mana''']
|5
|Regenerate 35 SP per 5 second. You need other performer to cast this song, Bard or Dancer is fine either way
|-
|}

At this point, you'll have 9 Skill Point left. Here's few suggestion for your rest of skill point
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!style=" width: 20%" |Skill

!Notes
|-
|[[File:MW_.png]] '''Max Your Ensemble'''
|5
|You can maxed out [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Acoustic_Rhythm '''Invulnerable Siegfried'''], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Battle_Theme '''A Drum on the Battlefield'''], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Harmonic_Lick '''The Ring of Nibelungen'''] if you have dancer at disposal.
|-
|[[File:Death_Valley.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Death_Valley '''Death Valley''']
|5
|It revives target but drain it's SP. In practice, SP is way more precious than HP. You should use {{Item List |id=610 |item=Yggdrasil Leaf |simple=yes}} instead and let the priest heal them. '''You can revive people with Evil Druid armor using this skill'''
|-
|[[File:Reverberation.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Reverberation '''Reverberation''']
|5
|Deals (800% ATK + 600% MATK) * (base_level/100). Which means, the damage scale with level. It's kinda like trap, but explode after 13 second. Be sure to get [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dominion_Impulse '''Dominion Impulse'''] if you decided to get this skill. Also, the physical portion deals elemental damage according to your weapon element and somehow it's considered as '''Melee attack'''
|-
|[[File:Metallic_Sound.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Metallic_Sound '''Metallic Sound''']
|5
|Deals 1200% MATK * (base_level/100). I'm using this on my bard because you'll get lv 1 reverberation, thus able to help dealing more damage compared to other choice.
|-
|[[File:Tarot_Card_of_Fate.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tarot_Card_of_Fate '''Tarot Card of Fate''']
|5
|If you don't really want to deal damage and wanted to do something fun with RNG. It actually affected by Bragi so you can spam them when bragi'd by other bard
|-
|[[File:Severe_Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Severe_Rainstorm '''Severe Rainstorm''']
|4-5
|You can only put level 4 with 9 leftover. You can sacrifice one of [[File:MW_.png]] '''Bard's Ensemble''' skill point if you want.

[[File:Final skill tree.png|thumb|1000|Final skill tree. Click to enlarge]]

=== Super Saiyan Mode ===
You can become super saiyan when recieved [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Bard_and_Dancer_Spirits '''「Soul Link」'''] buff. That buff will gave you :
*All Performance Skills will affect the target him/herself.
*Greatly increases Movement Speed while performing.
*Allows the use of the lv 10 dancer skill, such as :
**[[File:Focus_Ballet.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Focus_Ballet '''Humming''']. Adds 20 + DEX/10 HIT

= Equipment =
You dont really need any particular equip as long as you have 150 INT. What I listed below is some equip suggestion to make your INT 150 without clementia or increasing your DEX more than 150. I only list the largest drop rate mob on "Way to obtain" column, you can check complete list of who dropped the item by clicking item name.
