= Overview =
Sura is the third job class for Champion (you can change into a Sura as a Monk but it is '''highly recommended not to''').  Suras are much more powerful than their second job and transcendent counterparts.  They gain a variety of Area of Effect abilities, the ability to have up to 15 maximum spheres instead of 5 thanks to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rising_Dragon Rising Dragon], new powerful buffs and the ability to start a combo instantly thanks to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Combo Dragon Combo] and  [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flash_Combo Flash Combo].  

Sura's main damaging abilities, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] gain damage from having high Maximum HP.  This means their builds usually revolve around balancing a high health pool with a high amount of ATK.  Finally, Suras have gained one of the most debilitating debuffs in the game, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cursed_Circle Cursed Circle], which allows a Sura to prevent up to 14 non-boss type enemies from attacking or casting skills for 7 seconds.  All of these combined make Sura a highly desirable class for PvP, War of Emperium and Battlegrounds.

Additionally, thanks to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mental_Strength Steel Body] from the Monk skill tree, Sura still remains a viable tank for the majority of [https://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Instances Instances] and can be useful for tanking certain MvPs.

'''Disclaimer''':  I have not finished this guide and I've been seeing people linking to this page.  There are some errors with the information and I will try and add to the guide as time goes on.

= Stats =
Here is an overview of the stats and what they do that benefit Sura.
*'''STR''' - Increases your Status Attack (the left ATK number on your stats screen) by 1 per point  Increases your weight limit by 30 per point.  One of Sura's main stats.
*'''AGI''' - Increases your Attack Speed and Flee.  Having high AGI increases the damage of  [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Sky_Blow Sky Net Blow] and ASPD affects how fast you can use combo skills and how fast you can snap around.
*'''VIT''' - Increases your Maximum HP by 1% per point and increases the effectiveness of healing items. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell]'s damage increases based on your Maximum HP and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Stun stun immunity] is granted at 100 VIT which makes this important.
*'''INT''' - Increases your Maximum SP by 1% per point and increases the effectiveness of SP healing items.  Reduces variable cast time.  SP affects [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and  [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] and the cast time is very handy.  Good to invest points into.
*'''DEX''' - Increases Status Attack by 1 per 5 points, increases your HIT by 1 per point reduces variable cast time '''with twice the effectiveness as INT '''and increases attack speed.  Very valuable stat even in small numbers.
*'''LUK''' - Increases your total ATK by 1 and your HIT by 1 every 3 points.  Increases perfect dodge.  Useful in very small numbers when STR becomes expensive to put points into.

= Builds =
The type of build that you are using generally depends on the main skill you want to use.  Most people make hybrid builds that incorporate the three damaging skills, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike], so that the only thing they need to do is swap their equipment to do something else.    These builds below should guide you towards the stats needed to help you make the most of what skill you choose to use.

=== Sky Net Blow [ Leveling Build ] ===
*'''STR''' - 80+
*'''AGI''' - 80+
*'''VIT''' - 80 - 100
*'''INT''' - 45
*'''DEX''' - 60 - 80
*'''LUK''' - 20 - 40
At the lower levels, while you have very little skill points to spend, using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Sky_Blow Sky Net Blow] is pretty much your only choice - it's the best Area of Effect ability you can get early and only requires you to invest a few points into [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Sky_Blow Sky Net Blow] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gentle_Touch-Energy_Gain Gentle Touch-Energy Gain] as part of the build.  This build lets you spam Sky Net Blow without having to worry about spheres as long as you have Energy Gain active (and the SP required to use Sky Net Blow).  As you get more skill points, you should prioritize getting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rising_Dragon Rising Dragon] to level 10.  After that, you should aim towards getting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] to level 10.

Sky Net Blow damage increases with '''AGI''', so AGI serves as a stat to help you survive and a damage stat.  '''VIT''' is needed for increasing your health - you'll most likely be taking damage while using this skill as you need to gather enemies up and wait for them to be in range of Sky Net Blow when you use it.  '''INT''' is to help with SP regen and giving you a nice SP pool to use the skill with.

When you have level 5 or higher Rising Dragon, using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Power_Absorb Power Absorb] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Zen Dangerous Soul Collect] is a very effective way of recovering SP and can be used in your entire leveling career if you wish.

This build is recommended until around '''level 135''' - at this point, the enemies you'll be fighting to level will have too much HP for the skill to be effective in killing them.  Hopefully, by then you will be able to swap into your real damaging skills such as [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flash_Combo Flash Combo].

=== Tiger Cannon [ All-around build ] ===
*'''STR''' - 100 - 120 (If you are using Temporal Boots of Strength)
*'''AGI''' - 50 - 70
*'''VIT''' - 100 - 120 (If you are using Temporal Boots of Vitality)
*'''INT''' - 100
*'''DEX''' - 90
*'''LUK''' - 20 - 40
[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] is one of the strongest tools a Sura has available.  It is an Area of Effect ability that can be used on its own or used in a combo with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Combo Dragon Combo] in order to double it's damage output.  This combo bonus does '''not work '''when used with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flash_Combo Flash Combo].  Tiger Cannon, when used on its own or through Dragon Combo, will drain a percentage of your Max HP and Max SP.  If used through Flash Combo, it will '''not drain anything''', which makes it a popular choice to use for any PvM or MvP activities.  The downside with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flash_Combo Flash Combo], aside from the reduced damage, is that it prevents you from doing anything else (even '''using items''') which makes it risky to use in certain situations, mainly any PvP activity.

Although Flash Combo is an excellent leveling tool, the problem with using it is that if the enemy you target dies during the Fallen Empire part of the skill, it will '''not cast Tiger Cannon''' and just skip to the Sky Net Blow part.  So this is why I recommend a different build for the earlier levels, since Fallen Empire is usually enough to kill individual enemies.

[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] damage scales off of the users '''ATK, Max HP and Max SP'''.  In terms of increasing damage, MaxHP has the biggest effect, then ATK slightly behind, then MaxSP.  This means for your build you should aim to have a high health pool with a high amount of ATK.  Since the gears that increase these stats can be expensive, using SP increasing gear can be a great alternative and also can help with your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] damage if you choose to use it.

Because the skills require nearly the same stats, it is possible to also use [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] effectively with this build.  There is a good amount of DEX and INT to reduce the variable cast time if you wish to cast it on its own or you can use it from the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Combo Dragon Combo] combo for high single target damage.  A common strategy for doing very high single target damage is to do a combo [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and then immediately after do another combo for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] as you'll do more damage with Gates of Hell thanks to the HP drain from Tiger Cannon.

While this is not a dedicated [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] build, the damage is high enough to still kill low-tier MVPs with ease and players provided you have the right equipment on.

=== Asura Strike [ MVP, PVP ] ===
*'''STR''' - 120
*'''AGI''' - As low as possible
*'''VIT''' - 80 - 100
*'''INT''' - 100 - 120
*'''DEX''' - 80 - 100
*'''LUK''' - 20 - 40
Although not as powerful as it was in pre-renewal, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] is still one of the hardest hitting attacks in the game.  There are plenty of MVPs that can be one shot with Asura Strike, and the number only increases as you start giving yourself more buffs or MVP with more than one person, for example, a priest with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Lex_Aeterna Lex Aeterna] will make it possible for you to one shot the majority of field MVPs.  In WoE/PvP, most people do not opt for an only Asura Strike build the skill forces you to be '''unable to regenerate SP for 10 seconds after casting''', making it more of an all-in attack than it used to be.  This means there are situations where it can be used effectively, but it shouldn't be the only skill you use.

[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] damage is based on your Max SP (and your current SP percentage) and your ATK.  It is recommended to equip as much SP or ATK increasing gears because of this.  Additionally, you must always be as close to full SP as possible before using the skill to maximize the damage you do.

This skill has great synergy with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cursed_Circle Cursed Circle] as it will prevent enemies around you from interrupting your cast or, verus players, from dodging the skill by using Hide.

== Equipment ==
I've mentioned the stats needed to make the above builds shine so I'm making a list of items that are good for Sura and a brief explanation why they are good.  You will have to pick and choose which items you use based on what you want to do with your Sura.  Also, these are just my personal recommendations, do not feel like these are the only options, but they are notable options. 

=== Headgears ===

==== Top Headgears ====
* {{Item List|id = 5393|item = Love Valentine's Hat|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the Cash Shop.  Different stats on NovaRO.  Gives 7% increase to Max HP and Max SP which makes it one of the better currently available headgears for Tiger Cannon and also is useful for Asura Strike.  Unfortunately, it is not slotted.
* {{Item List|id = 5208|item = Rideword Hat [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained through a quest or the Cash Shop.  Currently the best leveling headgear and one of the best for overall PVM.  Can be slotted with an {{Item List|id = 4269|item = Incubus Card|simple = yes}}, {{Item List|id = 4468|item = Dark Pinguicula Card|simple = yes}}, {{Item List|id = 4910|item = Essence of Evil STR3|simple = yes}} or a {{Item List|id = 4582|item = Bungisngis Card|simple = yes}}if the hat is refined to +8 or higher.
* {{Item List|id = 5374|item = Gigantic Majestic Goat|simple = yes}}
Obtained through a quest.  The current best choice of headgear for dealing damage to Demi-Human enemies.  Increases your ATK based on your Job Level.
* {{Item List|id = 5170|item = Feather Beret|simple = yes}}
Obtained through a quest.  The current best choice of headgear for reducing damage from Demi-Human enemies.
* {{Item List|id = 5363|item = Abysmal Knight Helm [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the Cash Shop.  Reduces damage from Boss type enemies by 10% at the cost of increasing damage from everything else by 5%.   A solid headgear for tanking in [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mental_Strength Steel Body] or just to wear to help mitigate damage while fighting bosses.  I recommend slotting an {{Item List|id = 4919|item = Essence of Evil VIT3|simple = yes}}or {{Item List|id = 4582|item = Bungisngis Card|simple = yes}}for survivability, {{Item List|id = 4127|item = Nightmare Card|simple = yes}}or a {{Item List|id = 4354|item = Gemini-S58 Card|simple = yes}}for status immunity.
==== Middle Headgears ====
* {{Item List|id = 18874|item = Monocle [1]|simple = yes}}
The only slotted middle headgear that drops from enemies.  Does not give anything but a slot.  Use either an {{Item List|id = 4269|item = Incubus Card|simple = yes}}, {{Item List|id = 4468|item = Dark Pinguicula Card|simple = yes}}or an {{Item List|id = 4910|item = Essence of Evil STR3|simple = yes}}in it for damage or{{Item List|id = 4354|item = Gemini-S58 Card|simple = yes}}for status immunity.  For PVP you may want to use a card such as {{Item List|id = 4271|item = Giant Hornet Card|simple = yes}}for elemental resistances.
* {{Item List|id = 18519|item = Evil Wing Ears [1]|simple = yes}}
Requires the original Evil Wing Ears and a Spiritual Auger from the Cash Shop to slot them.  Offers +1 STR for a minimal increase in damage over the other middle headgears.
* {{Item List|id = 5641|item = Robo Eye|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the Cash Shop.  Offers 2% ATK and 2% MATK as well as +1 DEX.  Not slottable.  Is an okay option but doesn't compare to slotted middle headgears
* {{Item List|id = 5800|item = Blush of Groom|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the Cash Shop.  Used for reducing damage from Demi-Human enemies.

==== Lower Headgears ====
* {{Item List|id = 18505|item = Umbala Spirit|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the Cash Shop.  Gives 1% Max HP for increasing [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] damage.  Increases the healing effectiveness of Meat while giving a chance for them to drop.  Helpful for leveling with the use of {{Item List|id = 4437|item = Hell Poodle Card|simple = yes}} to make Meat a viable healing option.
* {{Item List|id = 5305|item = Pirate Dagger|simple = yes}} or {{Item List|id = 5361|item = Gangster Scarf|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the Cash Shop.  Gangster Scarf can be obtained through a quest as well.  Another damage increasing option.
* {{Item List|id = 5377|item = Gentleman's Pipe|simple = yes}} or {{Item List|id = 18750|item = Poker Card in Mouth|simple = yes}}
Obtained from Cash Shop.  The lower headgear options for reducing damage from Demi-Human enemies.

=== Weapons ===
* {{Item List|id = 16028|item = Thanatos Hammer [1]|simple = yes}}
Purchased from the [[Ghost Palace]] instance using Gray Shards.  This piece of equipment should be one of your top priorities if you plan on using your Sura as a damage dealer for any instances or for farming.  Allows you to gain SP and HP back on a chance when dealing damage with any of your physical skills.  A powerful weapon at higher refines as well.  The leeching effect '''stacks with '''{{Item List|id = 5208|item = Rideword Hat [1]|simple = yes}}.  I'd recommend either a {{Item List|id = 4115|item = Hunter Fly Card|simple = yes}}for general use, {{Item List|id = 4140|item = Abysmal Knight Card|simple = yes}}for MVPing or a {{Item List|id = 4608|item = White Knight Card|simple = yes}}for all around use if you also plan on using this weapon while wearing a shield with a {{Item List|id = 4609|item = Khalitzburg Knight Card|simple = yes}}.
* {{Item List|id = 16040|item = Crimson Mace [2]|simple = yes}}
Dropped from a wide variety of monsters.  Like most other Crimson Weapons, it can drop with pre-determined elements; Neutral, Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Holy, Shadow and Poison.  At '''+10 or higher it becomes an extremely strong weapon, but is on par with most other weapons until then.  '''Due to the popularity of the item, they are fairly easy to find and are relatively cheap to buy unrefined.  These make great weapoins even if they aren't very high refined thanks to the elements that they come with, which makes leveling a lot easier since you don't have to endow yourself, which in the case of Holy is very helpful.  Since this has 2 slots, I personally recommend either using 2 {{Item List|id = 4115|item = Hunter Fly Cards|simple = yes}}for leveling, 2 {{Item List|id = 4608|item = White Knight Cards|simple = yes}}if you have a very high refined Crimson Mace or a {{Item List|id = 4608|item = White Knight Card|simple = yes}}and {{Item List|id = 4140|item = Abysmal Knight Card|simple = yes}}for fighting MVPs.
* {{Item List|id = 16033|item = Robot's Mechanical Arm [2]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the final boss of the [[Charleston Crisis]] instance. A very high ATK weapon. The bigger brother to the {{Item List|id = 16003|item = Carga Mace [2]|simple = yes}}, being a level 4 weapon and much more expensive.  If you use this weapon, it should be at a high refine (+7 or higher).  I'd recommend only investing into getting a high refined version of this weapon when you have the  {{Item List|id = 4608|item = White Knight Card|simple = yes}}and {{Item List|id = 4609|item = Khalitzburg Knight Card|simple = yes}}set available.
* {{Item List|id = 16003|item = Carga Mace [2]|simple = yes}}
Drops from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1206/anolian Anolian].  A powerful weapon that makes an excellent [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] weapon at the higher refines.  Either use 2 {{Item List|id = 4115|item = Hunter Fly Cards|simple = yes}}if you have an over-refined version of this weapon and don't want to use a {{Item List|id = 16028|item = Thanatos Hammer [1]|simple = yes}} for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] or use 2 {{Item List|id = 4140|item = Abysmal Knight Card|simple = yes}}s to help with your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] damage.  Since the release of Crimson Weapons, this weapon should be a cheap option.
* {{Item List|id = 1544|item = Lunakaligo [3]|simple = yes}}
Drops from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1986/tatacho Tatacho].  Inexpensive mace that is easily obtainable and as such is easy to over-refine.  Can be useful for the food drops when killing brute enemies if you feel that you want some extra stats for free.  At +10 or higher, this weapon becomes strong due to the three card slots it has.  Until that point, it's much easier to just invest in a +5 - +7 Carga Mace.  I would recommend using racial cards such as {{Item List|id = 4060|item = Goblin Card|simple = yes}}depending on which type of enemy you're fighting.
* {{Item List|id = 1525|item = Long Mace|simple = yes}}
Drops from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1150/moonlight-flower Moonlight Flower] or can be obtained from  {{Item List|id = 12623|item = High Weapon Box|simple = yes}}.  A defensive mace mainly used for PVP and War of Emperium, however, it boasts mediocre attack and is a level 4 weapon which makes it usable for doing damage if you have no other options.  Can also be [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Enchantment#Malangdo_Enchant Malangdo Enchanted] to have useful defensive stats such as MDEF. 
* {{Item List|id = 1546|item = Glorious Morning Star|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the [[Battlegrounds]] which requires you to be level 170 to participate in. The strongest weapon for fighting Demi-Human enemies when refined to high levels.  It is recommended that you have this refined to at least +6, otherwise, it is not worth using.
=== Armour ===
* {{Item List|id = 2394|item = Glorious Suit|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the [[Battlegrounds]] which requires you to be level 170 to participate in.  A very high increase in Max HP and some additional resistances to Demi-Human enemies.  A very strong armor for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] as you only need the Armor for the HP bonus and don't need to wear a full set of gear like the Gray set.
* {{Item List|id = 15095|item = Hero Judgement Shawl [1]|simple = yes}}
A potential reward from the {{Item List|id = 22537|item = Prize of Hero|simple = yes}}obtained from the MVP of [[Bios Island]] and [[Morse's Cave]].  Underappreciated armour.  Gives 5% Max HP and SP and gives +10 to ATK.  Has a chance of auto-casting Level 10 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kyrie_Eleison Kyrie Eleison] when doing auto attacks or reflecting damage.  When used with a {{Item List|id = 4031|item = Peco Peco Card|simple = yes}}it comes close to the damage from Glorious Suit but has more functionality due to the auto-cast and it giving 77 defense unrefined, whereas the Glorious Suit has 10 defense.
* {{Item List|id = 2374|item = Diabolus Robe [1]|simple = yes}}
Dropped from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1916/satan-morocc Satan Morocc] and his weakened version.  A good armor for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] on its own and a decent armor for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] if carded with a {{Item List|id = 4031|item = Peco Peco Card|simple = yes}}.  Can also be enchanted to have up to +3 of a bonus stat on it.  INT would be the better option.  Has a combo with {{Item List|id = 2729|item = Diabolus Ring [1]|simple = yes}} which increases your ATK by 3% to make this a strong set throughout all levels.
* {{Item List|id = 15048|item = WoE Robe [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the [[Guild Dungeon Investment System]].  The standard choice when it comes to PVP activities.  Should be refined to at least +6. You can wear this without the full set when it comes to PVP and War of Emperium because of the defensive stats it offers. It is recommended that you use a {{Item List|id = 4031|item = Peco Peco Card|simple = yes}} for survival and extra damage or a {{Item List|id = 4105|item = Marc Card|simple = yes}} to start off with.  If you have money to spend and have good equipment in your other slots, solid options for Sura are {{Item List|id = 4054|item = Angeling Card|simple = yes}} to reduce damage from the majority of common elements or {{Item List|id = 4047|item = Ghostring Card|simple = yes}} to lower the risk of other Suras killing you or reducing the damage from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2490/hell-plant Hell Plant].

Thanks to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gentle_Touch-Cure Gentle Touch-Cure] or 100 MDEF, you don't always have to use a {{Item List|id = 4105|item = Marc Card|simple = yes}}for PVP, however, if you do not have access to gear for getting 100 MDEF, it is highly recommended to wear a Marc when it comes to War of Emperium.

=== Shields ===
* {{Item List|id = 2115|item = Valkyrja's Shield [1]|simple = yes}}
Drops from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1765/valkyrie Valkyrie].  The best general purpose shield, giving you resistances to common elements and a little MDEF boost.  This is the default shield to use for Battlegrounds and War of Emperium.  Should be slotted with a card that reduces damage taken from a race such as {{Item List|id = 4058|item = Thara Frog Card|simple = yes}}, an all around defensive card like {{Item List|id = 4413|item = Hodremlin Card|simple = yes}}or an {{Item List|id = 4253|item = Alice Card|simple = yes}}if you'll be using the shield for MVPs.  If you are using a {{Item List|id = 4608|item = White Knight Card|simple = yes}} in your weapon, it's recommended to also use a {{Item List|id = 4609|item = Khalitzburg Knight Card|simple = yes}}.
* {{Item List|id = 2168|item = Immune Shield [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained through a variety of methods but the most recommended are [[Battlegrounds]] and [[Monster Hunter]].  This shield '''is useless until +7'''.  At +7 and above, it has a nice use for farming, MVPs and in certain situations, PVP.
* {{Item List|id = 2124|item = Thorny Buckler [1]|simple = yes}}
Drops from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1838/knocker Knocker].  When used with a {{Item List|id = 2702|item = Bison Horn [1]|simple = yes}}it ends up being a nice tanking shield when using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mental_Strength Steel Body] as the reflect lets you keep the monsters attention on you.  Ar higher levels, using this set with a {{Item List|id = 15095|item = Hero Judgement Shawl [1]|simple = yes}}gives you more chances to auto-cast the Level 10 Kyrie Eleison effect.
=== Garments ===
* {{Item List|id = 20718|item = Giant Snake Skin [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the [[Faceworm's Nest]] instance.  You can read more about how the skins work [[Faceworm's Nest|here]].  For Sura, you'll either want VIT enchantments to enhance your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] damage or INT to enhance your  [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] damage by making your SP increasing equipment have a better effect  This garment also has a combo with Temporal Boots to increase your HP and SP, making it the ideal garment for Sura damage.  Depending on your stat priority, you'll either want to use a {{Item List|id = 4588|item = Wakwak Card|simple = yes}}or a {{Item List|id = 4589|item = Jejeling Card|simple = yes}}in this garment.
* {{Item List|id = 2554|item = Nidhoggur's Shadow Garb [1]|simple = yes}}
Dropped by [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/2022/s-nydhog Nidhoggur's Shadow].  A mediocre garment for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] if you do not have access to Temporal Boots and a Giant Snake Skin but not useful for anything else. You'll want either a {{Item List|id = 4588|item = Wakwak Card|simple = yes}} or an {{Item List|id = 4402|item = Aliot Card|simple = yes}} to increase your Asura Strike damage.
* {{Item List|id = 2587|item = WoE Muffler [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the [[Guild Dungeon Investment System]].  Part of the WoE Robe set, used as defensive gear in PVP.  Do not wear unless you also have a {{Item List|id = 15048|item = WoE Robe [1]|simple = yes}} and {{Item List|id = 2485|item = WoE Shoes [1]|simple = yes}} equipped.   Very common and cheap to get.  Cards to use for PVP are {{Item List|id = 4133|item = Raydric Card|simple = yes}} if you are worried about neutral damage, {{Item List|id = 4334|item = Noxious Card|simple = yes}} as a balance between reducing ranged damage and having some neutral resistance or {{Item List|id = 4095|item = Marse Card|simple = yes}} and similar elemental reduction cards if you're worried about a particular element.  If you''' '''feel that Asura Strike is an issue for your character to survive, you can also use a {{Item List|id = 4174|item = Deviling Card|simple = yes}} card but '''only''' recommended for tanking Asura Strike.

=== Boots ===
* {{Item List|id = 22006|item = Temporal Boots of Strength [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from [[Old Glast Heim]] using Temporal Crystals.  You can read more about [[Temporal Boots|Temporal Boots here]].  These can be enchanted for massive stat boosts such as Fighting Spirit 7 for even more ATK and Bear's Might for a chance at getting '''+200 STR when being attacked'''.  Temporal STR boots are a popular all around choice due to the massive ATK boost that you gain from having 120 STR. Due to having 120 STR to get the best effect from these boots, you can also use {{Item List|id = 2894|item = Glove of Shura|simple = yes}} for a massive attack boost using  [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] or combining it with attack percentage gear like {{Item List|id = 2981|item = Hero Ring|simple = yes}} (when enchanted) and {{Item List|id = 2992|item = Pendant of Maelstrom [1]|simple = yes}} for very hard hitting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon].  A {{Item List|id = 4381|item = Green Ferus Card|simple = yes}} card is ideal for Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell, {{Item List|id = 4107|item = Verit Card|simple = yes}} can be used for an all around build and {{Item List|id = 31022|item = Abandoned Teddy Bear Card|simple = yes}} is ideal for Asura Strike damage.
* {{Item List|id = 22007|item = Temporal Boots of Vitality [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from [[Old Glast Heim]] using Temporal Crystals.  Should be enchanted with Fighting Spirit 7 and Bear's Might, ideally.  The alternative to Temporal Boots of Strength, requiring you to have 120 VIT over 120 STR so it focuses more on having a much larger health pool for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell] damage.  When paired with a high VIT enchanted {{Item List|id = 20718|item = Giant Snake Skin [1]|simple = yes}} this set helps you reach the highest health pool possible.  Because these boots require you to have 120 VIT, use a {{Item List|id = 4381|item = Green Ferus Card|simple = yes}} to compliment the boots best.
* {{Item List|id = 2485|item = WoE Shoes [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from the [[Guild Dungeon Investment System]].  Part of the WoE Robe set, used as defensive gear in PVP.  Do not use unless you are wearing it with a {{Item List|id = 15048|item = WoE Robe [1]|simple = yes}} and {{Item List|id = 2587|item = WoE Muffler [1]|simple = yes}}.  Because this is a purely defensive item, the only card option is {{Item List|id = 4381|item = Green Ferus Card|simple = yes}}.

=== Accessories ===
* {{Item List|id = 2981|item = Hero Ring|simple = yes}}
Purchased and Enchanted with {{Item List|id = 6684|item = Token of Hero|simple = yes}}which are obtained by completing [[Bios Island]] and [[Morse's Cave]].  An amazing accessory that is very good in both PvM and PvP.  Can be enchanted to have at most +5 VIT, +5% Max HP, +5% ATK and some defense or magic defense, which makes it excellent for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tiger_Cannon Tiger Cannon] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gates_of_Hell Gates of Hell].  Alternatively, you can enchant it for Max SP, ATK and INT for Asura Strike better accessories for that job.  
* {{Item List|id = 2992|item = Pendant of Maelstrom [1]|simple = yes}}
Obtained from [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] by merging a {{Item List|id = 2990|item = Pendant of Chaos|simple = yes}}and a {{Item List|id = 2991|item = Pendant of Harmony|simple = yes}}together.  One of the better damage accessories which also offers a slot.  Has a chance to auto-cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Maelstrom Maelstrom] which can protect you from ground targeted skills, however, the cast delay can hurt you in some situations.  You can put an {{Item List|id = 4910|item = Essence of Evil STR3|simple = yes}}or a {{Item List|id = 4508|item = Gold Scaraba Card|simple = yes}}for a minor improvement in [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guillotine_Fist Asura Strike] damage.
* {{Item List|id = 2923|item = Str Glove [1]|simple = yes}} and {{Item List|id = 2926|item = Vit Glove [1]|simple = yes}}
Stat Gloves are obtained using [[Stat Gloves|Splendide Coins]].  These are both relatively cheap options that are good throughout the entire game.  Choose one of them depending on your stat priority, although {{Item List|id = 2926|item = Vit Glove [1]|simple = yes}} can be used as a defensive accessory all around. For PvM, because these accessories are cheap, I would recommend using these accessories as a stepping stone to better gear, and as such, would card with relatively cheap cards that will improve your damage or make your life easier in certain situations, such as {{Item List|id = 4077|item = Phen Card|simple = yes}} for uninterruptable cast time, {{Item List|id = 4909|item = Essence of Evil STR2|simple = yes}} as a cheap source of ATK or {{Item List|id = 4079|item = Mantis Card|simple = yes}} as an even cheaper source, {{Item List|id = 4437|item = Hell Poodle Card|simple = yes}} while leveling to make potting inexpensive.
* {{Item List|id = 2898|item = Black Rosary [1]|simple = yes}}
Drops from [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1291/wraith-dead Wraith Dead] and [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/2283/dark-priest Dark Priest].  An extremely cheap and easy to obtain defensive accessory that can be used in place of {{Item List|id = 2926|item = Vit Glove [1]|simple = yes}}.  Usually used in PVP settings because of the '''15 MDEF''' it offers.  Recommended to put helpful PvP cards in them such as {{Item List|id = 4044|item = Smokie Card|simple = yes}}and {{Item List|id = 4103|item = Vit Glove [1]|simple = yes}}.
* {{Item List|id = 2772|item = Glorious Ring|simple = yes}}
Obtained from [[Battlegrounds]].  Another defensive accessory that offers resistances to elements, a decent HP boost and a boost to attack speed.  A very good ring which can also be used for general farming or tanking if you wish.
* {{Item List|id = 2949|item = Silverwork Bracelet [1]|simple = yes}} and {{Item List|id = 2621|item = Ring [1]|simple = yes}}
These accessories are some of the cheapest accesssories in the game that also offer useful stats for Sura.  If you're really struggling for money but want to have accessories that give stat bonuses and useful for most characters then you can invest in these.  You can put any cards that you feel would benefit you in these.  {{Item List|id = 2949|item = Silverwork Bracelet [1]|simple = yes}} makes an excellent accessory for putting in cards that give you extra drops such as {{Item List|id = 4389|item = Plasma Card|simple = yes}} or {{Item List|id = 4187|item = Raydric Archer Card|simple = yes}} because all classes can equip it from a relatively early level.

=== Equipment Sets ===
These are items that need to be worn in a full set for them to really shine.  These items have the benefit of being cheap and can last you until max level if you are unable to replace equipment.
* Gray Set: {{Item List|id = 18820|item = Gray Helmet [1]|simple = yes}}, {{Item List|id = 15091|item = Gray Robe [1]|simple = yes}}, {{Item List|id = 20721|item = Cloak of Gray [1]|simple = yes}} and {{Item List|id = 22033|item = Boots of Gray [1]|simple = yes}}
Each piece of the set is purchased from the [[Ghost Palace]] instance using Gray Shards.  Combined, the set offers you +25% Increased HP and SP, +15% Neutral Resistance and +10% MATK.  The HP, SP and Neutral Resistances make this set one of the best tanking sets in the game for Sura and a handy leveling set.  Each item also offers holy resistance which can be helpful in some situations.  Each piece of equipment having a slot means that you can enhance the bonuses even more or use the slots to help with immunity to statuses.  I recommend these cards depending on the item, with a brief explanation for why:
* {{Item List|id = 18820|item = Gray Helmet [1]|simple = yes}}:  {{Item List|id = 4269|item = Incubus Card|simple = yes}}to use with a {{Item List|id = 4218|item = Succubus Card|simple = yes}}, {{Item List|id = 4127|item = Nightmare Card|simple = yes}} for sleep immunity if required or {{Item List|id = 4582|item = Bungisngis Card|simple = yes}} if refined for HP.
* {{Item List|id = 15091|item = Gray Robe [1]|simple = yes}}: {{Item List|id = 4218|item = Succubus Card|simple = yes}}for health, {{Item List|id = 4031|item = Peco Peco Card|simple = yes}} for even more health or {{Item List|id = 4105|item = Marc Card|simple = yes}} for when you're fighting bosses or regular enemies who can freeze you.
* {{Item List|id = 20721|item = Cloak of Gray [1]|simple = yes}}: {{Item List|id = 4133|item = Raydric Card|simple = yes}}or {{Item List|id = 4334|item = Noxious Card|simple = yes}}for damage reduction.
* {{Item List|id = 22033|item = Boots of Gray [1]|simple = yes}}: {{Item List|id = 4381|item = Green Ferus Card|simple = yes}}or {{Item List|id = 4107|item = Verit Card|simple = yes}}for survivability.

= Skills =
Here will be a short description of important skills and their uses.

==== Acolyte ====
* '''[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Increase_AGI Increase Agility]''' - Increases the target's AGI and Movement Speed.  A very important buff that I recommend maxing.
* '''[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Blessing Blessing]''' - Increases the target's DEX, INT and STR.  Another very important buff that I recommend maxing.
* '''[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Decrease_AGI Decrease Agility]''' - Decreases an enemy's AGI and Movement Speed.  Extremely useful in PVP but limited usage against monsters.  Max for PVP but otherwise don't invest in it.
* '''[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Angelus Angelus]''' - Increases soft defense for you and your party.  Recommended to have for fighting monsters but otherwise, I would not invest points into.
* '''[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Warp_Portal Warp Portal]''' - Allows you to use the command "/memo" to save a location on certain maps.  Can be used for quick access to dungeons such as Sphinx F4 and outside the portal to Magma Dungeon 2.  Needed for Pneuma.
* '''[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pneuma Pneuma]'''- Blocks ranged attacks, causing them to miss.  Can still be knocked back by ranged knockback effects, even if they miss you.  Useful in any situation you are against a ranged enemy.

==== Monk and Champion ====
* '''Call Spirits''' - Used to summon spheres one at a time.  Although you get a better alternative as a Champion, Call Spirits can still be used in certain situations, such as quickly getting a sphere to snap out of danger.
* '''Absorb Spirits''' - Absorb the spheres from your target to recover SP.  Can be used on non-boss enemies to have a chance at recovering SP.  Used to maintain your SP in PvM and to hinder other Suras in PvP.
* '''Dangerous Soul Collect''' - The Champion alternative to Call Spirits.  Summons '''the maximum amount of spheres you can have''', which means 5 without Rising Dragon and up to 15 with Rising Dragon.
* '''Snap''' - Your main mobility skill.  Your snap speed depends on your attack speed.  Costs a sphere to use unless you're in Fury status.
