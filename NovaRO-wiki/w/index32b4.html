Greetings one and all! First of all, welcome to NovaRo. I am known as Wolv and I mostly main support classes. Here is an introduction and guide to my favorite and most played class in the game, the Minstrel. Minstrels, or Maestros depending on what server you are in, are some of the most essential classes to have in a party and can have the same importance as an Archbishop in terms of allowing your party to conquer instances. The Minstrel's most iconic skill remains to be '''A Poem of Bragi'''   [[File:Bd_bragi.png|frameless|24x24px]] which can be accessed early on the second stage Bard class. It is so iconic in fact, that Minstrels are often referred to as '''''Bragi''''' and alternative accounts have been made for " '''''Bragi''''' " slaves. 

For some people having the Minstrel play {{Skill List |id=321 |skill=A Poem of Bragi |simple=yes}} is enough, but I will share with you the knowledge I have gained from several experiences throughout the game. There is more to a Minstrel than simply being a bragista and when I am done with this guide, I hope that you will share my love of the class.

Fair warning, this guide is meant and tailored for '''''NovaRO''''', I cannot promise the same results for other servers.

&lt;div style="float:left;">__TOC__&lt;/div>

= Overview =
[[Image:Character_Minstrel.jpg|thumb|200px|Official Maestro Illustration]]
The Minstrel class is only accessible by male Archers. This is because the Performer Class set of Bard and Dancer are gender locked. Males can only be Bards, and females can only be Dancers. With that said their play styles have some similarities but have access to different skills. As most of my experience is only applicable to the male line, I shall only cover the Bard class. 

Minstrels are also one of the few classes that rely on other party members of the same Class ( i.e. Wanderer or Minstrel ). A lone Performer Class in a party will lose access to very powerful skills that are under the '''Ensemble''' or '''Chorus''' skill trees. For example, performers have skills that can add at least a 5% Ranged damage increase or provide at least 15% elemental reduction for defensive capabilities. Having multiple performers in the same party can definitely boost the overall power.

The role of Minstrels mainly involve providing song buffs that increase the party's overall damage output and help support the Archbishop in keeping the party alive and running. With the right build Minstrels can dish out reliable sustained damage that can help hasten the death of MVPs and large mobs with their offensive skills dealing about 100k to 150k on average in mid to late game.

With that said, Minstrels can also act as a secondary source of DPS(Damage Per Second). While the damage may not be as great as damage-oriented classes ( i.e. Rangers, Rebellions, Warlocks, Guillotine Cross, etc etc. ), Minstrels have access to skills that can rival the damage output of damage-oriented classes and kill end-game mobs. 

Personally I play a Minstrel that also provides secondary damage rather than simply being a Full Support Singer Minstrel. Also I tend to have stronger levels of damage than some not so excellently geared Rangers. Not to brag ( Get it? ), but Minstrels can have greater Damage with 
{{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} than {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm|simple=yes}}Rangers if only stats are considered into the equation. It's just easier for Rangers to get extremely high damage because they have access to better gear PvM wise. Also Rangers don't build for support while Minstrels are often criticized if they don't just stick to support skills.

= Cast Time vs. Cast Delay =
Before I go into any major details for Minstrels, I'll need to explain what the difference is between '''Cast Time''' and '''Cast Delay'''.

=== Cast Time ===
Cast Time involves the amount of time your character spends between the command you provide for the skill to be used, to the actual time the skill will be performed. Cast Time for the '''Renewal''' system of Ragnarok Online involves 2 parts: '''Fixed Cast Time''' and '''Variable Cast Time'''. 

'''Variable Cast Time''' is the portion of your Cast Time that can be reduced by the '''Intelligence[INT]''' and '''Dexterity[DEX]''' stats. It is possible to achieve 100% Variable Cast Time reduction purely on stats alone. This is the equation:

&lt;pre> 100% Variable Cast Time Reduction = 2X[DEX] + [INT] = 530 &lt;/pre>

While this does indeed look like a daunting number, it is quite possible with the right number of stat boosting foods such as:

*+10 '''INT'''{{Item List |id=12204 |item='''Dragon Breath Cocktail''' |simple=yes}}
*+20 '''INT'''[[File:Cocktail.png]][http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12430/warg-blood-cocktail '''Warg Blood Cocktail'''] 
*+10 '''DEX'''{{Item List |id=12205 |item='''Hwergelmir’s Tonic''' |simple=yes}}
*+20 '''DEX'''[[File:Icetea.png]][http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12432/siroma-icetea '''Siroma Icetea''']

There are other ways to increase your stats, however I will not be covering them in this guide. 

=== Cast Delay ===
Unlike '''Cast Time''', '''Cast Delay''' involves the amount of time a character can cast another skill. Each skill provides a certain period of Cast Delay that will prevent the character from casting any other skills. '''Cast Delay''' should not be mistaken as '''''Cooldown''''' as Cooldown refers to the set time the same skill can be used ''repeatedly'' without affecting other skills. For example, Minstrels have a skill called {{Skill List |id=2413 |skill=Metallic Sound |simple=yes}} which has both a '''Cooldown''' and a '''Cast Delay'''. Once it has been performed, a certain period of time will prevent the Minstrel from using any other skills that they may have. That is '''Cast Delay'''. After Cast Delay is over the player may then cast any other skills that he or she may want. On the other hand Metallic Sound also has a '''Cooldown''' which prevents the Minstrel from casting Metallic Sound again until the '''Cooldown''' finishes.

Unlike cast time, you cannot decrease Cast Delay using your stats.

=== Extra Note ===
There's an additional source of delay that may add to Cast Delay which is called '''Animation Delay'''. Animation Delay is the actual time the character '''''performs''''' the skill, hence the name animation. This can be decreased based on your attack speed and '''Agility[AGI]''' stat however I will not go into detail on this guide.

= Stat Influence = 
In this section I will explain the importance of each stat to a Minstrel although I will not cover the general effects of each statistic in great detail.
In the past stats affected Minstrel songs but with a big overhaul job change, stats no long influence the song skills of bard.

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!style=" width: 20%" |Stat 
!Notes
|-
|Strength [STR]
|'''STR''' is mainly used to increase Physical Attack[ATK] as well as carrying capacity. This is the least important statistic to have for a Minstrel whether you are going for a more offensive or supportive build. To be more specific STR is the stat that primarily affects ATK when using melee weapons. ATK when using bows and instruments are also increased but not to the same extent as it does with melee weapons such as Daggers.
|-
|Agility [AGI]
|'''AGI''' is the primary stat used for increasing Attack Speed[ASPD] as well as Flee. AGI also helps decrease Animation Delay. As a Minstrel keep this stat in mind but do not worry about prioritizing it. While FLEE is indeed important for Minstrels, the main draw of this stat is its ability to increase the Attack Damage of {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}}. But I will cover that in more detail at the skills section.
|-
|Vitality [VIT]
|'''VIT''' is important for providing status immunities like '''Stun''' and is the primary stat that increases your Health Pool[HP] as well as your Physical Defense[DEF]. This stat is VERY important for Minstrels. The class is no good to the party dead and Minstrels are often the last characters standing in a party. Make sure to place a lot of stat points in this.
|-
|Intelligence [INT]
|'''INT''' is the main source of Magical Attack Damage[MATK] and Magical Defense[MDEF]. INT also increases Maximum SP pool which you need to cast skills. INT is '''''THE''''' most important stat for Minstrels. Not only does it increase a Minstrel's ability to survive Magic Attacks, it also ensures that Minstrels can USE their skills. Minstrel skills '''''DRINK''''' SP faster than most classes and the base SP pool that Minstrels get is small, often plateauing between 2000 to 3000 without the use of Cards and equipments that increase MaxSP.  Trust me, though this sounds large it is not enough for the amount times the skills must be used. 
|-
|Dexterity [DEX]
|'''DEX''' is the primary source for Ranged Physical Attack Damage[Atk] as well as Accuracy[HIT]. DEX also reduces Variable Cast Time. DEX is important as Minstrels are Archer classes and {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}}  is a Physical Ranged source of damage. Keep this into consideration in any builds.
|-
|Luck [LUK]
|'''LUK''' is there to provide a lot of benefits such as status immunities and also provides increased Atk and MAtk, increased HIT and FLEE. This is a bit more complicated but Minstrels do benefit from the increased FLEE and for those who make Crit builds for fun. Keep this in mind but don't focus on it.
|-

= Skills = 
=== Archer Job Skills ===
The Archer Class Skills are pretty straight forward and there's only a few of them.
 '''Note: Archer class gives enough skill points to make sure that only one of the skills cannot be maximized.'''

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!style=" width: 20%" |Skill
!Possible Max Level
!Notes
|-
|{{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}}
|10
|Basic single target damage output that can be powerful for early game leveling. Can also be used late game if the Minstrel needs to provide some form of additional Damage. Uses 2 arrows when activated.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=47 |skill=Arrow Shower |simple=yes}}
|10
|Basic Area of Effect[AoE] damage source that also provides a Knockback effect. Although the damage is slightly weaker than Double Strafe the AoE and Knockback effect more than covers the weakness. I personally love this skill as it helps provide survivability to the Minstrel. It's also a better leveling tool than Double Strafe as it only uses 1 arrow and provides breathing room for the Minstrel to survive and run away.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=45|skill=Improve Concentration |simple=yes}}
|10
|Provides increased Dexterity and Agility Stat when used. Extremely useful and must always be on.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=43 |skill=Owl's Eye |simple=yes}}
|10
|Adds a passive and permanent Dexterity Stat bonus.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=44 |skill=Vulture's Eye |simple=yes}}
|10
|Adds additional attack range for Bows. 1 additional tile range per level. Can be useful in a lot of cases, but this is arguably the least important skill to maximize for a bard.
|-
|}

=== Bard/Clown Job Solo Skills ===
Now we get to the fun part. The skills in this stage are crucial even in late game.

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!style=" width: 20%" |Skill
!Possible Max Level
!Notes
|-
|{{Skill List |id=304 |skill=Adaptation to Circumstances|simple=yes}}
|1
|This skill is a pre-requisite to all the other bard skills. The skill cut down sp usage of bard songs by 20% is really great to have for lower levels when bard sp is still extremely low. It stacks with Encore so you can pretty much stop worrying about sp if you only use one song.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=318 |skill=Frost Joker|simple=yes}}
|5
|It's a very fun skill to have as it can freeze all enemy mobs, party members, and the bard using the skill. It has a 40% chance of successfully freezing anything but it can be quite nice in keeping mobs at bay if the bard has a way to keep itself from freezing.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=315 |skill=Music Lesson |simple=yes}}
|10
|Increases the effects of Bard songs, ability of the Minstrel to have increased MaxSP, and increases the Atk damage and Attack speed of Instruments. This skill is very important and must always be maxed in order to provide the best song buffs possible.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=317 |skill=Dissonance |simple=yes}}
|5
|This skill is a pre-requisite to the Bard songs and some of the Minstrel offensive skills and has limited use for PvM. The damage it provides is negligible but is useful for detecting hidden enemies at times. Apply skill points on this to access the more important skills later down the line. I've heard that it's very nice for PvP but as this is PvM this skill won't see much use except for helping take aggro away. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=320 |skill=Assassin Cross on Sunset |simple=yes}}
|10
|Provides an ASPD bonus to all players within a 31x31 range by 20%. This skill is vital as classes like Genetic and Guillotine Cross depend on this buff to reach full 193 ASPD while still being able to gear for high damage. Always take this. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=322 |skill=Apple of Idun |simple=yes}}
|10
|Increases MaxHP and provides a big 20% boost to received healing. This is very important to help with overall survivability of the party, and also provides a massive damage increase to Rune Knights that build for Dragon Breath. Fair warning, while it does increase MaxHP it doesn't give the party the Full HP immediately so they will have to be healed by Priests or use recovery items to fully benefit from it. This skill can make or break parties as it can be used to help prevent a party wipe. With this skill on simply having the AB's in the party use 1 Culoceo heal and sanctuary can prevent a party wipe.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=319 |skill=Whistle|simple=yes}}
|10
|Adds Flee and Perfect Dodge. Useful to help prevent deaths and keep the tank alive. Not as commonly used as the other songs but it does have good utility for keeping up flee based characters.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=321 |skill=A Poem of Bragi |simple=yes}}
|10
|Provides '''Cast Delay''' and '''Cast Time''' . This is the '''MOST''' important skill to have as a Minstrel. Always Max this skill. The ability to continually utilize skills without having to wait for the Cast Delay to resolve is crucial to a successful Instance run. Sometimes dungeons become impossible ''without'' the effect of [[File:Bd_bragi.png]]. In every build, ALWAYS have this skill. 

|-
|{{Skill List |id=305 |skill=Encore |simple=yes}}
|1
|Using this skill allows the Minstrel to replay the last song ( {{Skill List |id=317 |skill=Dissonance |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=321 |skill=A Poem of Bragi |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=319 |skill=Whistle|simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=322 |skill=Apple of Idun |simple=yes}}, and {{Skill List |id=320 |skill=Assassin Cross on Sunset |simple=yes}} )  that was used at half the sp cost. Very important for early game and even late game to some extent due to the low sp pool that Minstrels have sometimes.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=316 |skill=Musical Strike |simple=yes}}
|5
|This is a pre-requisite skill for the Minstrel's more powerful offensive skills. The damage to musical strike scales with the player's level and hits 2x like the Archer's {{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}}.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=394 |skill=Arrow Vulcan|simple=yes}}

|Most powerful 2nd class offensive skill of Minstrel. It is a solo target damage skill that fires a concentrated burst of "9" strikes using 1 Arrow.

While on it's own the damage is very lackluster the damage is increased massively with the equipment combination of {{Item List |id=1935 |item=Ukulele of Newoz |slots=2}} and {{Item List |id=2988|item= Hero Ring of Newoz |slots=1}}. The damage of the skills scales up with the player's level so it can provide a very solid damage source. Keep in mind that the skill forces you to stand still, so I'd avoid using it when  you're surrounded. 

Keep in mind though, that you can still use other skills while your character is on the animation for {{Skill List |id=394 |skill=Arrow Vulcan|simple=yes}}. For example, after {{Skill List |id=394 |skill=Arrow Vulcan|simple=yes}} you can cast {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill= Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} to deal some extra DPS.

|This skill is mostly for fun in PvM as the effects aren't as great when compared to their effects on players in PvP.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=396 |skill=Marionette Control |simple=yes}}

|This skill is complicated and seems to be broken, it is supposed to add half of the Minstrel's stats to the target however no stat can exceed 99 but in some cases it does allow the stat to increase higher than 99. This is mostly used to help Genetics make potions and is not really used for PvM.

=== Bard/Clown Job Ensemble Skills ===
Ensemble skills are the abilities Bard/Minstrels can only use if they have a Dancer/Wanderer in the party with them along and having them both at close proximity to each other. Both the Bard and the Dancer must be within 4 tiles from each other for the skill to activate. In the past both partners must have the same song, but with the job update that is no longer necessary.

''' Only 1 ensemble song can be active at any time '''

'''Ensemble Fatigue'''

Now while ensemble skills are powerful, once casting the song neither the Bard nor the dancer will be able to use a skill for a short duration regardless of who casts the ensemble skill.

|This is the Tarot Card buff skill to the Ensemble songs. This ensemble songs can randomly give one of the following buffs: Aspd +20%, Atk +20%, MAtk +20%, Max HP +30%, Max SP +30%, All Stats +15, Hit+ 50, Flee +50, Reduce Sp consumption of skills b 30%, Increased HP recovery by 100%, and Increased SP recovery by 100%. It's VERY random and you can't tell what is provided to you unless you are staring at your stat screen.

It can be VERY helpful for Alchemists with it's +15 stats and it does have some rather nice buffs. The only issue is that it's hard to tell what buff is applied.

I highly suggest grabbing it

Ensemble songs are amazing. Use them as you deem fit and always keep at least one Ensemble song active at any time.

|{{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}}
|5
|N/A
|This is the best AoE skill of Minstrel. Using 20 arrows a large Area get's continuous damage for a set period of time. As a skill with base affects, it is more powerful than a Ranger's Arrow Storm Skill [[File:Arrow_Storm.png]]. The main difference is that Arrow Storm deals BURST damage, while Severe Rainstorm Deals continual Damage. This can be used when using ether a Bow or an Instrument and cannot change to other weapons while this skill is active.

Damage wise using {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} with an instrument yields stronger damage as it scales more with instruments rather than bows.

During the duration of the Skill, bow skills such as {{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=47 |skill=Arrow Shower |simple=yes}}, as well as certain Minstrel attack skills like {{Skill List |id=2414 |skill=Reverberation |simple=yes}}, and {{Skill List |id=2413 |skill=Metallic Sound |simple=yes}} may be used when equipped with a bow. 

If equipped with an instrument Bard skills can be used during the skill's duration.

|Reverberation is one of the main Attack skills Minstrels can use. It deals both Melee Physical Attack Damage, and Magical Attack Damage. The damage is dealt in 2 bursts, 1 for Physical Atk and 1 for MAtk. It functions similar to a ranger's trap and has a 3x3 AoE. This is nice to use against MVPs who are busy attacking the Tank of the party.

|Like Reverberation, this skill can be used while singing. This is the "Nuke" skill of Minstrels. By itself the damage is low, however if equipped with 1 or even 2 {{Item List |id=2899|item=Sound Amplifier |slots=1 |simple=yes}}  the damage scales very high at the cost of more sp. I personally love using this to finish off wounded enemies and is a great damage source. It can easily become the strongest damaging skill the Minstrel can have in their arsenal in terms of Magic damage.

Consumes {{Item List |id=6144|item=Regrettable Tear |num=1 |simple=yes}} per cast.

=== Minstrel Job Chorus Skills ===
[[Image:Character_Maestro.jpg|thumb|200px|Official Alternate Outfit Minstrel]]

Chorus skills get their own branch because like Ensembles, they need to have a partner in the party. The main difference in Chorus skills however, is that gender does not matter to use them. It is possible to have at least 2 Minstrels or 2 Wanderers to cast the skill rather than requiring a Minstrel + Wanderer combo although having that pair allows for a more varied skill set along with the potential to use ensembles.

Chorus skills are on of the main reasons why having at least 2 performers is great in a party.

The main disappointment is that Chorus Skills do not stack as they belong to the same Song Groups. They can also interfere with other none Chorus skills that are part of the same Song Group.

!Notes
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2426 |skill=Great Echo |simple=yes}}
|5
|N/A
|This is 1 the only damage dealing Chorus skill. It's a pretty fun skill to use because whenever it's cast all the affected targets within it's area of affect do a somersault and then get damaged. It deals damage to a 9x9 area with about 5500% Atk. It's pretty amusing to watch both players and mobs get flipped. On a more serious note, this skill consumes {{Item List |id=11513|item=Throat Lozenge |num=10 |simple=yes}} per cast. Though it's not used often, it CAN deal quite the large amount of damage. 

Another important thing to note is that {{Skill List |id=2426 |skill=Great Echo |simple=yes}} deals Ranged Physical Attack Damage so if the Minstrel already wore gears for {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} then it would be a possible to turn this into a powerhouse skill. 

One just needs to be careful about the Cast Delay and Cooldown that it creates.

|-

= Equipment and Cards=

The general rule of thumb when deciding for Minstrel equipment is either "How can I survive?" or "How can I dish out more damage?"

In the past it was mandatory for Minstrel to reach "150" Int due to Poem of Bragi, but now that is not the case as songs do not get affected by stats.

For offensive roles go focus on Magic if you wish for Metallic Sound, or go for Dex and Ranged damage if you wish to go for physical skills like Severe Rainstorm, Arrow Vulcan, or Reverberation.

I'll be listing some general core choices for gears as well as a budget gear build. Keep in mind these are only my recommendations so feel free to use anything else that I haven't listed if they strike your fancy. 

For equipment that are the easiest to get for new players I will place a '''BUDGET''' quote on the beginning of the description.

|This is a very helpful, albeit difficult to obtain, hat to use. It does help increase Arrow Vulcan Damage which is necessary to make it pack a really big punch in renewal, and {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} gets a very nice boost. It will be weaker than a {{Item List |id=5905|item= +7 Lyrica Hat |slots=1}} unless you have a higher refine rate at about +10 but that can be very difficult. Instead get the bonus damage for {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} at a weaker percentage while having bonus to MaxHP and MaxSP. It also increases long ranged damage by 1% per upgrade so a +7 would provide 7% increased physical ranged damage.

|This is for the more offensive oriented builds. The base effect reduces fixed cast time by 5% per level of Voice Lessons which means that it will always give 50% fixed cast time reduction due to how Voice Lessons are always maxed out.

|-
|{{Item List |id=15121 |item=Sarah's Battle Robe|slots=1}}
|[[Sarah and Fenrir]] Instance
|This is probably the best source of MAtk for a Minstrel that wants a powerful  {{Skill List |id=2413 |skill=Metallic Sound |simple=yes}} and  {{Skill List |id=2414 |skill=Reverberation |simple=yes}} if a {{Item List |id=15146 |item=Flattery Robe|slots=1}} cannot be afforded.

|Clock
|The chance to cast Auto-Guard is very welcome.

|Probably the best garment for sp economy which Minstrels can need.

|Best in slot for magical damage bonus when enchanted. Can be very pricey however.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2992 |item= Pendant of Maesltrom |slots=1}}
|[[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] Instance
|Cheaper option than {{Item List |id=2963 |item= Physical Enhancer Ring |slots=1}} but it's still really great with it's +6% Atk and +6% MAtk bonus. It also casts a skill that protects you from AoE spells. It also give +1 to each stat.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2899 |item=Sound Amplifier |slots=1}}
|Creamy Fear
|Great accessory which effectively cuts variable cast time by half and also increases Metallic Sound Damage. Without this accessory, metallic sound will be a lackluster skill since it already has a long cooldown. You can usually by this from player vendors as they often sell them in bulk.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2988 |item= Hero Ring of Newoz |slots=1}}
|[[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] Instance
| ''' Budget ''' Useful only if you pair it with {{Item List |id=1935 |item=Ukulele of Newoz |slots=2}} for Arrow Vulcan. Otherwise, ignore it and just use {{Item List |id=2899 |item=Sound Amplifier |slots=1}}.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2981 |item= Hero Ring}}
|Bios Island and Morse Cave Instance
|Very useful, albeit a bit more expensive than others, as it has to potential to give up to +5 int along with increasing MAtk, Atk, Def, Mdef, HP or SP depending on enchants. Really great if you want it.
|-
|{{Item List |id=28326 |item=Broken Chip 01 |slots= 1 }} and {{Item List |id=28327 |item=Broken Chip 02 |slots= 1}}
|[[Last Room]] Instance
|VERY powerful given that having both accessories can give up to +12 int and +12 Str. Consider it strongly if you are in need of more int or if you want more damage with the Str it gives.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2724 |item= Medal of Honor(Archer)}}

|This one is still a decent pick and gives nice bonuses
|-
|{{Card |id=27108 Singing Ferre card}} and {{Card |id=27107 Playing Ferre card}}
| [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] Instance
| These two cards are great as a combo to increase damage in general. When equipped together the cards provide a big 50% damage increase to both Reverberation and Metallic Sound.
|-
|{{Item List |id=4913 |item=Essence of Evil Int 3}}

|-
|{{Item List |id=22009 |item=Temporal Int Boots |slots=1}}

| rowspan="2" |Verus Chip Set
|Str+8 Int+8
|Last Room Instance
|Very Nice Bonus that can be achieved by having both {{Item List |id=28326 |item=Broken Chip 01 |slots= 1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=28327 |item=Broken Chip 02 |slots= 1 |simple=yes}}
|-
|Atk +50, MAtk +50, Movement Speed +40%
|Last Room Instance
|This effect happens if {{Item List |id=18997 |item=Runaway Chip |slots= 1 |simple=yes}}  is equipped together wih {{Item List |id=28326  |item=Broken Chip 01 |slots= 1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=28327 |item=Broken Chip 02 |slots= 1 |simple=yes}}. Fair warning, {{Item List |id=18997 |item=Runaway Chip |slots= 1 |simple=yes}}  decreases MaxSp unless it's upgraded to +9 refine. 
|-
| Ulle's Armor Set
| Decreases 10% SP consumption
| Monster Drop
| Pretty simple to obtain and is often sold at a cheap price. It's a nice leveling equipment set using {{Item List |id=5123 |item=Ulle's Cap |slots= 1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=2353 |item=Odin's Blessing |slots= 1 |simple=yes}}.
|-
| Airship Set
| MaxHP +25%, MaxSP + 25%, and Increased Movement Speed.
| Airship Asssault
| This is a solid choice for leveling and is fine to use till other gears are collected. The equipments include {{Item List |id=20743|item=Airship Manteau |slots=1}}, {{Item List |id=15116|item=Armor of Airship |slots=0}}, and {{Item List |id=22046|item=Boots of Airship |slots=0}}.
|-
| Ferlock's Set
| MaxHP +25%, MaxSP + 25%, and Increased Movement Speed. If overall refine is 30 or greater, additional +5%MaxHP and +5%MaxSP
| Airship Asssault
| This is the upgraded version of the regular Airship set and can be quite fine to use in the end game. The equipments include {{Item List |id=20744|item=Ferlock's Manteau |slots=1}}, {{Item List |id=15117|item=Ferlock's Armor |slots=0}}, and {{Item List |id=22047|item=Ferlock's Boots |slots=0}}.
|-
|}

=== Extra Note ===
A fun build you can try is having both the Ferlock's Set and the Full Verus Chip set to create a very fast walking Performer. With both Movement Speed buffs you can cross distances very quickly allowing you to provide your musical buffs to a scattered party, or to reposition quickly. Keep in mind that you'll be sacrificing a {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Dex Boots |slots=1}} but this is still viable.

|-
|{{Item List |id=1926 |item=Harp of Nepenthes |slots=2}}
|Nepenthes Drop
|This is an expensive but very decent level 4 instrument with 2 card slots. A good enchanted Harp can let the Minstrel use different gears and cards for either damage or survivability. It's enchantable via [[Malangdo Enchant]]
|-
|{{Item List |id=1933 |item=Thanatos Violin |slots=1}}
|[[Ghost Palace]] Instance
|'''Budget'''Very easy to get and gives a solid +6 Intelligence boost on it's own along with +6 Vit. The main downside however is that it eats hp every time it get's unequipped. It can be enchanted with different useful enchants and is a level 4 instrument that can hold it's own in late game. It's always a solid pick.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1920 |item=Berserk Guitar |slots=0}}
|Salamander Drop
|This is a more situational instrument. I mostly use this in [[Sarah and Fenrir]] instance as it makes the Minstrel achieve 193 aspd every time. Just be sure to have plenty of Luk to get some accuracy. 
|-
|{{Item List |id=1934 |item=Contabass |slots=2}}
|[[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] Instance
| Pretty solid instrument choice for Metallic Sound centric Minstrels. Second only to Thanatos Violin for solid MAtk bonus.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1935 |item=Ukulele of Newoz |slots=2}}
|[[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] Instance
| This is the instrument that will give you the best {{Skill List |id=394 |skill=Arrow Vulcan|simple=yes}} Damage, though the effect will only occur when wearing {{Item List |id=2988|item= Hero Ring of Newoz |slots=1}}. The 2 card slots do provide some extra versatility as well. It's also a level 4 instrument.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1939 |item=Crimson Violin |slots=2}}
| Violy, Evil Nymph, Miyabi Ningyo, and Kavach Icarus Drop
| Only worth it at +10 and above. Gives decent damage for {{Skill List |id=394 |skill=Arrow Vulcan|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=316 |skill=Musical Strike |simple=yes}}. {{Item List |id=1935 |item=Ukulele of Newoz |slots=2}} will still out-damage this instrument when it comes to Arrow Vulcan damage, but the Minstrel won't be forced to use {{Item List |id=2988|item= Hero Ring of Newoz |slots=1}}.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1900 |item= Vicious Mind Violin |slots=1}}
|[[Sky Fortress]] Instance
| This violin is extremely powerful IF you can get it to at least +10. It has a wide variety of powerful enchants and deals considerable amount of damage. If you can get a +10 or +15 then you are set for late game.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1930 |item=Green Whistle |slots=1}}
|Antler Scaraba and Alpocchio drop
| Similar to Harp of Nepenthes, Green whistle can be enchanted with Int stats while also decreasing sp cost of {{Skill List |id=2381 |skill=Windmill Rush |simple=yes}} per refine level. Just a word though, use this only for leveling if you have no better instrument. I personally do not recommend this for late game builds of any kind. Still, feel free to try this out if you wish. If you have a good enchanted one, then go ahead and use it.
|-
|{{Card |id=4094 Archer Skeleton card}}
|Archer Skeleton
|'''budget''' simple and solid boost to 10% ranged attack.
|-
|{{Card |id=4608 White Knight card}}

|Extremely powerful card especially when in a combo with {{Card |id=4609 Khaltizburg Knight card}} on the shield
|-
|{{Card |id=4665 Bio5 Trentini card}}
|Bio 5 mob
|Best card to boost up Severe Rainstorm Damage
|-
|}

=== Bows ===
While Instruments are a better choice, bows are still a good choice of weaponry for Minstrels. Here are some Bows that are pretty nice to use. Keep in  mind that Bows can cast Severe Rainstorm, Metallic Sound and Reverberation, but you cannot use any Minstrel/Bard songs.

{| class="wikitable" style=" width: 95%"

! style=" width: 12% " | Way to obtain
! style=" width: 70%" | Notes
|-
|{{Item List |id=18130 |item=+15 Crimson Bow |slots=2}}
| Owl Baron, Bow Guardian, and Kavach Icarus Drop
| Arguably the best  bow when it comes to pure damage, though the difference in damage when compared to {{Item List |id=18123 |item= Bow of Storms |slots=1}} is pretty small so this isn't entirely a requirement.
|-
|{{Item List |id=18123 |item= Bow of Storms |slots=1}}
| Nightmarish Jitterbug Instance
| While the damage potential isn't as high as Crimson Bow unless refined to at least +15, Bow of Storms is still an extremely great bow that adds a large amount of damage. The best part is that it lowers {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} cooldown by 2 seconds which is quite a lot of cd reduction. It does increase the sp cost by 15 though that's not too much of an issue. 
|-
|{{Item List |id=18119 |item= Thanatos Bow |slots=1}}
| Old Glast Heim Instance
| This bow will not grant the Minstrel the same damage as Crimson Bow and Bow of Storms will. What it will do however is arguably more important. It leeches sp. I cannot stress enough on how important this can be if the Minstrel lacks SP pots. {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} hits multiple times and gives plenty of sp to the Minstrel every time the bow decides to do so. Ths is very nice to have, especially when leveling.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1746 |item= Elven Bow |slots=1}}
| Gargoyle Drop
| Probably the next best source for ranged damage though it won't give the same levels as Bow of Storms and Crimson Bow. Must be used with {{Item List |id=1773 |item= Elven Arrow}} to provide great damage. It must also be highly refined. 
|-
|{{Item List |id=18103 |item= Mystic Bow |slots=0}}
| Queen Scaraba, Boss Alpoccio, and Boss Trentini Drop
| This is a pretty odd one. It decreases {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm|simple=yes}} sp cost by 10, gives +4 Int, and also gives 100 MAtk. It's pretty neat in it's own way. Nice bow to use for leveling if access to Thanatos Bow is cut.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1720 |item= Rudra Bow |slots=0}}
| MVP Sniper Cecil, High Weapon Box
| This is another amusing one. It gives +5 Int and let's the Minstrel cast level 1 Heal and level 1 Cure. It's safe to say that it's meant for Full Support Minstrels. 

Honestly this is more for gimmicky bows, but it can still be fun to use.

| Still a very good shield to use for a lot of different runs, especially great for it's Neutral resistances
|-
|{{Item List |id=2122|item=Platinum Shield |slots=0}}
| Sword Guardian
| A shield that can provide a 40% chance to reflect spells, have a built in 15% reduction against Mid and Large monsters, and 10% from undead monsters, a DEF of 95, and an MDEF of +5... What's more to like? The only downside to this shield is the lack of a card slot.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2187|item=Gray Shield |slots=1}}
| [[Ghost Palace]]
| Best Shield to Use against Holy element. It is also the best shield for Mdef builds.
|-
| {{Card |id=4413 Hodremlin Card }}
| Hodremlin
| Great for it's overall 15% damage reduction from small, medium, and large monsters. The +30 PDodge that can happen is a great plus to. Use this for overall resistances.
|-
| {{Card |id=4609 Khalitzburg Knight Card }}
| [[Old Glast Heim]]
| This is an even better version of the Hodremlin card as it gives a solid +20 DEF and gives 25% reduction towards Medium and Large enemies. It doesn't provide the extra PDodge but it does provide a Damage boost if paired with a {{Card |id=4608 White Knight Card }} 
|-

As stated above, I have not listed all the possible equipment and cards one can use. These are simply some recommendations I can provide.

== Song Buff Stacking ==

Since the update on performers, performer buffs that belong to a "Song Group" can be buffed in the following set-up:

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!style=" width: 20%" |Song Group
!Songs

|-
| {{Skill List |id=5007 |skill=Frigg's Song|simple=yes}}
|Can be casted on it's own
|-
|}

Remember that only one song per song group may be casted at any time.

== Builds ==
Just as I said before this will be builds for PvM and are also examples. Feel free to simply use them to get an idea on what Minstrels can do and change it to your liking. 

Either way however you MUST have the following skills: {{Skill List |id=321 |skill=A Poem of Bragi |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=320 |skill=Assassin Cross on Sunset |simple=yes}}. These 2 songs are arguable the most powerful buffs in the game and is why parties want to have a Maestro in the first place.

No matter what type of play you want to do, unless it's for solo PvM runs, a party will not welcome you if you do not have those 2 songs to eliminate the Cast Delay and increase ASPD (Especially for parties that have Dorams as the main damage dealer).

=== Pure Performer ===
----
This build is for individuals who wish to focus on nothing but the Minstrel's support role. With this set-up the main focus is being able to live through monsters and always keeping up important song buffs. Besides that, just make sure you keep a close eye on your party's health bar and assist the AB in resurrecting fallen allies. 

==== Stats ====
*'''STR''' 50 ~ 90
*'''AGI''' 90
*'''VIT''' 120 ~ 130
*'''INT''' 100
*'''DEX''' 90 ~ 100
*'''LUK''' 1 ~ 10 - Or perhaps reach 0 with something that lowers luk to prevent the Curse debuff.

==== Skills Build Consideration ====

|}

The main goal in this build, like mentioned earlier is to primarily survive and keep all the songs buffs up as often as possible. At end game all possible song combinations MUST BE up. In my build I have 1 level off Assassin Cross of Sunset but feel free to allocate a point here instead of Apple of Idun if you wish. Use Poem of Netherworld snares to trap and stall Enemy mobs, Siren's Song to keep mobs off of you and don't be afraid to cast a cheeky Frost Joker if you want. 

Make sure to cast Encore and Adaptation to circumstances to help sp economy. One great tip is to cast Song of Mana then switch immediately to Song of Warg

=== Hybrid Physical Damage ===
----
This is a build for the more experienced players. DPS will only be viable with good endgears at endgame but with that said, it's is still a very viable build to have, especially when leveling. Stack up on ranged damage and get either Dex or Agi boosting gears. Remember that Severe Rainstorm scales very high with an Instrument and with Agi. 

On lower levels it's better to use a bow when doing Severe Rainstorm as bows typically have better damage earlier. Instruments would be better late game with more experience points. 

==== Stats ====
*'''STR''' 1 ~ 30
*'''AGI''' 120
*'''VIT''' 90 ~ 100
*'''INT''' 90 ~ 100
*'''DEX''' 120 ~ 130
*'''LUK''' 1  ~ 10

Use Severe Rainstorm on big scattered mobs, especially when the mobs are going for your support players. Don't be afraid to draw in the aggro as you have the tools necessary to survive and kill them. If nothing else it's better for you to be the one to act as a meat shield as the dps kill the mobs on the back. With that said be very careful in not taking the lure'd mobs from the tank. In those cases it's better to cast Arrow Vulcan for single target damage.

Use poem of the netherworld to trap mobs and use that to either run away or finish them off. One thing I do want to mention is that while you are doing damage, primarily you MUST ALWAYS KEEP YOUR SONGS UP. What separates a good experienced bard player from a new one is the ability to deal damage while having every single song up. This includes resurrecting fallen allies and switching to necessary songs.

Overall however, have fun with this build.

= Leveling =

You can kill most mobs there with  {{Item List |id=1752|item=Fire Arrow |num=1 |simple=yes}} as well.

* '''Lv 85 - Lv 114'''
 Now around this level range it is ideal to have a dancer partner and continually cast {{Skill List |id=307 |skill=Mr. Kim a Rich Man |simple=yes}} as that 60% increased Exp bonus is extremely nice to have

** Level range to join the first bracket of [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Leveling_Guide#Gramps Gramps quests]. Note that Gramps quests are rotated at the start of every month. You can also hunt them outside of Gramps map. Use the &lt;code>@whereis (monster name)&lt;/code> command to find out where a monster spawns.

In gramps quest, Severe Rainstorm can be very helpful and is a great source of a big AoE damage though do keep in mind that the cast time won't be fast unless you dumped all of the stats into Dex and Int. Still, it's great to use in case you want to deal damage in a Massive Mob that your lurer bring in.

* '''Lv 91 - Lv 99'''
**I highly suggest doing Siroma, Stapo, and Roween quests here as they are the fastest and easiest to do. Though I would really just focus on gramps.

=== Lv 100+ ===


* '''Lv 100'''
** Minimum level to access [[Sara's Memory]], [[Bangungot Hospital]], [[Infinite Space]]
*** You must complete [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Nurse_in_Port_Malaya Nurse in Port Malaya] quests to access Bangungot Hospital. 
* '''Lv 115 - Lv 144'''
** Level range to join the second bracket of Gramps quests. At this point Severe Rainstorm useability falls a little due to cast time. If you can get Temporal Dex Boots, take it to make SR more reliable.
* '''Lv 120'''
** Minimum level to access [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]], [[Ghost Palace]].
* '''Lv 125'''
** Minimum level to access [[Airship Assault]], [[Devil's Tower]].
* '''Lv 130'''
** Minimum level to access [[Old Glast Heim]] Normal Mode, [[Charleston Crisis]], [[Buwaya Cave]].
* '''Lv 140'''
** Minimum level to access [[Horror Toy Factory]], [[Central Laboratory]], [[Malangdo Culvert]], [[Bakonawa Lake]].
*** You must complete [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Bakonawa_Extermination Bakonawa Extermination] to access Bakonawa Lake.
** Minimum level to do [[Dimensional Travel]]. This is a pre-requisite quest to access [[Bios Island]].

* '''Lv 145 - Lv 175'''
** Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests. Though keep in mind this is where your damage falls behind unless you have good damage gears and have elemental advantage.
* '''Lv 145'''
** Minimum level to access [[Sarah and Fenrir]].
** Additionally, I advice to join instances that people are are creating such as [[Old Glast Heim]] and ask them to place exp on share. The nice thing about leveling Minstrels is that as long as you have a high enough INT stat (Roughly 120 to 130 Int) your {{Skill List |id=321 |skill=A Poem of Bragi |simple=yes}} will be good enough to do the minimum job that parties want you to do. 
* '''Lv 160'''
** Minimum level to access [[Bios Island]], [[Morse Cave]], [[Temple of the Demon God]], [[Monster Hunter]], and [[Deserted Island]].


* 175 - 185
** This is the level range for the fourth bracket of Gramps quest. 
** Instead of gramps you can also join Magma 3 parties and hopefully get a Lava Leather equipment.
** As a minstrel you can easily join up a Bio 5 party as well and get some nice cards and monster drops that are for sale
