Before I start this guide, I just want to clear up that Royal Guard's main role in PvM is to be a support tank via Devotion and not be the main tank. The reason for this is that Sura's Steel Body, Doram's Stoop, Tuna Party and Arclouse Dash and Warlock's White Imprison are more reliable forms of tanking especially with how hard mobs and MVPs hit at end game. I am not saying that Royal Guards in no way can be the main tank but they require more equipment and support to become a viable end game tank. That being said, they are very much capable of tanking early to mid game MVPs even with just an Alice Card. Despite that, in PvP, they are the more reliable tanks due to the nature of how massive their HP pools are and all the defensive capabilities they have. Most of their class specific equipments are also high on DEF which makes them naturally tanky. If you are new to the class, I hope that you find this guide informative. Feel free to use #support if you have any questions. Good Luck with your journey!

== Overview ==
Royal Guards (or commonly known as "RG") specializes in being able to do "almost" everything by Supporting itself and it's party thanks to Crusader's/Paladin's skills Heal, Devotion and Gospel/Battle Chant and the newly acquired skills: King's Grace and Piety while still being able to be a strong Offensive member by dealing a large amount of damage with Banishing Point, Cannon Spear and Overbrand or use Banding with other Royal Guards to be able to use Hesperus Lit and Ray of Genesis.

This guide focus more on what Royal Guards can do and should do when solo-ing and in a party set up (mainly for PvM). Whether you want to farm or be competitive in getting MVPs or be annoying and supportive in PvP as much as possible.

== Stats ==
This section will help you understand what each Stats will do. Since Royal Guards have the option to be a Support, Tank or DPS, it will all come to what your preference will be. If you want to party or if you want to solo which also differs on PvM (Player versus Monster) and PvP (Player versus Player)

*'''STR''' - Your main Stat for DPS as it will not only increase your ATK but it also scales very well with Overbrand. It also increases your Weight Limit in which you need for equipping RG only equipment while also carrying consumables.

*'''AGI''' - Another main Stat for DPS if you would want to focus on using Banishing Point as your main source of DPS. Not only does it give Flee (which increases survivability) and ASPD, but it also gives you resistance to Bleeding, Sleep and Shadow Chaser's Masquerade Skills.

*'''VIT''' - The most important Stat of all as it increases your MaxHP, softDEF and HP recovery. A very important Stat for those who are using Devotion for supporting and Sacrifice as their main source of DPS. It also gives resistance to Blind, Crystallization, Poison and Stun. It also reduces the duration of most Status Effects.

*'''INT''' - An "okay" Stat since the main reason you will every get this is for increasing your MaxSP for spamming skills and Silence immunity. It also does give some SoftMDEF which is always nice for tanks.

*'''DEX''' - An important Stat for DPS as it will help increase your HIT rate that makes your attacks connect with enemies. It also scales with Overbrand and helps with reducing Variable Casting Time of skills.

*'''LUK''' - A not mandatory Stat since the only time you will put points into it is for Stat Point efficiency [which means that putting points into other Stats is more beneficial than putting it into one Stat. A good example of it is not maxing STR for ATK and stopping at a certain number (usually 120) and putting it into LUK]. It does give a lot of benefits like ATK, CritRate/Shield, Perfect Dodge and A LOT of resistance against Status Effects.


== Skills ==

I will only discuss what are the essential skills that a Royal Guard should know since there will be skills that you wont put any points on or will only put on them since they are a pre requisite of more important skills.

|-
| {{Skill List |id=367 |skill=Pressure / Gloria Domini |simple=yes}}

| One of the best supportive skills in the game. This skill is what makes the Crusader Class known for. It makes you protect a party member by receiving ALL the damage that is intended for your party member. It also shares all the Self Buffs that the Crusader has such as Auto Guard, Endure, Reflect Shield and Defender. The targeted ally's Skill Casts cannot be interrupted even in WoE and BG which makes this skill a MUST HAVE for those who intend to participate in PvP content and PvM parties. Best use is to target all the supports and the tank to make the Arch Bishop's life easier.
NOTE: Level range should be within 10 levels and YOU CANNOT TARGET OTHER CRUSADERS / PALADINS / ROYAL GUARDS

'''Recommended Level : 5 / Preference'''
|-

If the target has acquired a buff/debuff, they can acquire a new buff/debuff if they're still in the Area of Effect or return to it every 10 seconds.

|}

=== Royal Guard Skills ===

Now for the fun part!

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!Skill
!Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2308 |skill=Banishing Point |simple=yes}}
| One of your main DPS as it is easily spammable with high ASPD and is not reliant on having a Minstrel for Bragi. It's long range and is one of your early DPS on becoming a Royal Guard. Can easily achieve high DPS with Expert Archer Enchants and Long Range ATK modifiers but having high ASPD can be hard to come by if you are solo-ing.

'''Recommended Level : 10 for DPS'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2316 |skill=Exceed Break | simple=yes}}
| A self buff that makes the next attack deal a large amount of damage depending on the weapon's weight and weapon level. Acts similarly like Sacrifice but only for one hit. A great follow up after using all your skills.

'''Recommended Level : 0 or 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2313 |skill=Force of Vanguard |simple=yes}}
| Boosts maximum HP, physical defense, and grants a chance of building rage for a Rage Counter while taking damage. Rage Counter is used for Burst Attack. Rage is similar to Monk's Spirit Spheres wherein it gives a fixed amount of damage that doesn't miss. Also, the DEF boost isn't show on the Status Window.

'''Recommended Level : 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2322 |skill=Piety |simple=yes}}
| A pretty straight forward buff that endows a target and nearby allies with Holy Property.

'''Recommended Level : 0 or 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2311 |skill=Reflect Damage |simple=yes}}
| An improved version of Reflect Shield wherein the damage that you receive will be reflected on ALL the enemies in a 7x7 cell area around the you. It makes proc-ing Auto Casts much easier. Most notable is Hero Plate's Heal and Storm Gust.
NOTE: It has a reflect limit and it drains SP per second. Only use it if you need to proc Hero Plate's Heal and Storm Gust to create space if need be.

'''Recommended Level : 3 or 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2312 |skill=Pinpoint Attack |simple=yes}}
| One of your main offensive skill in PvP as it can remove Spirit Spheres or break the target's Shield, Armor or Weapon. It can also be used as a form of "blink" in PvM scenarios wherein the Royal Guard may have problems getting near mobs, most notable scenarios are the "Raydric" part of Old Glast Heim and killing Cecil Daemons in Bio Labs / Endless Tower. Damage scales with AGI.

'''Recommended Level : 1 or 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2314 |skill=Burst Attack |simple=yes}}
| A very situational skill that if used correctly can deal a HUGE amount of damage. The more Rage Counters you have and the lower your current HP is, the greater your damage will be.

'''Recommended Level : 0 or 1'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2309 |skill=Trample |simple=yes}}
| Performs a crushing stomp that has a chance of destroying any traps around the user, including any the user may be caught in. Explosive traps will still detonate normally, but there is a chance of dodging their damage. 

'''Recommended Level : 3'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2318 |skill=Prestige |simple=yes}}
| One of the best defensive skills in the game as it not only increases your HardDEF but also gives you a chance of dodging Magic Attacks depending on your INT and LUK stats. A must skill if you're planning to be the main Tank in the party.

'''Recommended Level : 3 (gives 100% upkeep at this level) or 5 (more DEF and magic dodge)'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2323 |skill=Earth Drive |simple=yes}}
| Probably one of the most underused skills from Royal Guards but also one of the most useful. It can hit concealed enemies and revealing them and remove any ongoing ground skills in the Area of Effect. Pretty powerful in any scenario as it can save you and your party from a strong spell.

'''Recommended Level : 2 (mainly for getting Shield Spell)'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5013 |skill=King's Grace |simple=yes}}
| Places a temporary buff on the user and all players nearby that blocks all damage, regenerates a portion of their Max HP every second, and purges and protects them of several status effects also making them unable to move, attack or use skills. They can only do is talk or sit until the duration. A pretty strong spell that if used properly, can save the whole party from a disaster, most notable scenario is from an MVP's Earthquake, Comet or Hell's Judgement.
NOTE: Casting this skill will remove Devotion from party members under the user's protection.

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2307 |skill=Cannon Spear |simple=yes}}
|  Cannon Spear has a longer, though narrow AoE than Overbrand, costs half as much SP, doesn't require a wall for optimum damage, and does not scatter mobs. Another thing to point out is that it shares it's main weapon with Banishing Point which is an Imperial Spear thus making it easier to make it "the AoE" skill for Banishing Point builds. Also scales with STR.

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2317 |skill=Overbrand |simple=yes}}
| One of the strongest skills in the game. Even without a good gear, you can easily deal around 30-50k damage with it (accounting that both Pierce and Smash damage hit). It is important to max it as soon as possible to make leveling and farming easy. One thing to remember is that under the effects of Bragi, it is spammable and the only thing that is slowing you down is ASPD and how fast can you click spam Overbrand. For it's AoE, check this [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Overbrand link]. Scales with STR,DEX and Spear Quicken's Level.

'''Recommended Level : 5 (I suggest maxing this skill no mater what build you're going)'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2319 |skill=Banding |simple=yes}}
| A buff that only activates when other Royal Guards in your party have Banding activated. It gives A LOT of ATK and DEF while also share same average HP with one another and they will regenerate HP 50% faster. Royal Guards that are Banded will be able to use Hesperus Lit and Ray of Genesis. Not only does it make you strong but it also makes your BOND with other Royal Guards stronger!

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2321 |skill=Ray Of Genesis |simple=yes}}
| The super upgraded version of Grand Cross that is targeted and can only be used while Banding with other Royal Guards and Inspiration. It deals Holy Hybrid Damage in a 11x11 area around that target. A pretty strong skill with draw backs, use with caution or under Banding.

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2324 |skill=Hesperus Lit |simple=yes}}
| A very strong damage skill that requires three or more Royal Guards in Banding. The damage and number of hits is further increased by the number of Royal Guards in Banding thus making it possible to one shot a lot of things with 12 Royal Guards using Banding and Hesperus Lit.

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2315 |skill=Shield Spell |simple=yes}}
| A self buff that gives random effects depending on the level of the skill and the DEF, MDEF and Refinement of the equipped shield. For more info, go to this [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shield_Spell link]. At least 1 point is recommended if you are going for a DPS oriented build and 3 points for tanking.

'''Recommended Level : 1 for DPS and 3 for Tanks'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2325 |skill=Inspiration |simple=yes}}
| A self buff that gives a massive amount of ATK, HIT, Stats and doubles your MaxHP. It removes all buffs and debuffs upon activation and requires 1% Base Experience. While under Inspiration, your HP and SP is slowly draining over time and drains 1% MaxHP for every attack or offensive skill. It also allows the use of Hesperus Lit and Ray Of Genesis when Inspiration is active.

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5014 |skill=Full Throttle |simple=yes}}
| Fully restores HP, increases all base stats by 20% and doubles movement speed. I usually use it when I don't have any consumables with me and need an emergency "Yggberry" or in conjunction with Inspiration to triple my DPS. Though there may be a "Rebound" status wherein after Full Throttle's buff expires, you will be slowed and prevents natural HP and SP recovery for 10 seconds. It also has a very long cooldown of 30 minutes. Use it wisely if you're ever going to get it.

'''Recommended Level : 0 - 5'''

||{{Card |id=4141 Evil Druid Card}}
||Enchants armor with Undead Property. Increases INT and DEF by 1. A great card for solo-ing as it gives you immunity to Stone Curse and Freeze and having high resistances to Shadow, Undead and Poison Property attacks. Do note that you cannot be Healed or Resurrected but Token of Siegfried still works.

|-
||{{Item List |id=1420 |item=Long Horn |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
||Cornus / Fallen Bishop
||A good upgrade from Lance due to it's Holy Property and indestructibility, especially when you already have access to Overbrand. Also a decent tanking weapon with Valkyrja's Shield due to having a chance to cast Assumptio or increase your ATK with Tournament Shield.

||Gryphon / Owl Duke / Anacondaq
||Best Two-Handed Spear for Overbrand builds but requires it to be refined at +15 to fully maximize it's effects. In my opinion, Crimson Spear can easily beat Crimson Lance just because of the existence of Mad Bunny and the Knightage Card Set. But since those are luxury items, it's actually better to start with a Crimson Lance just because of how easy to get and cheap they are.

==Pets==

Pets are actually an important part of the game. I can't stress enough of how strong some of them are especially the utility they can give. They literally give at least an effect of a card or an equipment when they become Loyal. They also attack from time to time. Feel free to pick and choose between the best pets available for the game.

== Builds ==

These builds will focus more on PvM rather than PvP.


=== The Farmer ===
----

This build will focus more on what gears are preferred when you choose Royal Guard for farming. They are great farmers since this build will focus more on STR thus having a huge amount of Weight Capacity and being tanky means that you wont have any trouble of dying unless lag happens.


==== Stats ====

*'''STR''' 120 - 130
*'''AGI''' 90 - 100
*'''VIT''' 90
*'''INT''' 50 - 90
*'''DEX''' 90 - 100
*'''LUK''' The rest goes here

Do note that it is recommended to have at least 90 INT to have Silence Immunity and to avoid having SP problems if ever you still don't have Rideword Hat, Thanatos Spear and Incubus Pet OR RNGesus isn't with you that SP leech doesn't proc. (always remember to pray)


==== Skills ====

==== Strategy ====
You can farm in the following:
*'''Gefenia''' = Sell everything to the NPC. Type @alootid -12020|-1974|-1919|-1421|-1478|-15037|-15036|-2318. This will make you not loot Cursed Water, Carrot Whip, Base Guitar, Battle Hook, Ahlspiess, Peuz's Plate, Ur's Plate and Lord's Clothes respectively. White Herb can be stored for Vending/@autotrade. Gemstones can also be stored just incase you want to have a Class that uses them. (Sorcerers and Arch Bishops)

*'''Glast Heim (gl_cas02)''' = Sell everything to the NPC EXCEPT for Worn Out Page, Bookclip in Memory and all the Books for making a Rideword Hat. Oridecon can be sold via Vending/@autotrade or keep it for upgrading your weapon (preferably Crimson Spear with Holy or Neutral Property). Type @alootid -15036|-2318|-15037|-2266|-1164|-13015|-2270|-2269. This will make you not loot Ur's Plate, Lord's Clothes, Peuz's Plate, Iron Cane, Muramasa, Hakujin, Romantic Leaf and Romantic Flower.

*'''Lighthalzen Field (lhz_fild02)''' = Sell everything to the NPC EXCEPT for Witch Stardust, Rough Oridecon, Crimson Spear, Crimson Revolver, Yggdrasil Seed, Dead Branch, and Delicate Foxtail Model. This is the best spot for farming your Crimson Spear (if you ever choose to go Overbrand build) while being able to farm Rough Oridecons to turn them into Oridecons and use them to upgrade your Crimson Spear. Do note that Crimson Weapons have different elemental properties so always check. Best properties to have are Holy, Neutral and to some extent, Fire. Type @alootid -2270|-2269|-1968|-1733. This will make you not loot Romantic Leaf, Romantic Flower, Skipping Rope and Gust Bow.

*'''Abyss Lakes (abyss_03)''' = Sell everything to the NPC EXCEPT for White Wing Brooch and Immortal Stew. White Wing Brooch and Green Ferus Card can easily be sold to players via Vending/@autotrade. Be careful not to get mobbed and from the MVP especially if you are not prepared or geared. Detale has Reflect Shield which can easily kill yourself with Overbrand.

*'''Thanatos Tower (floors 2, 6 and above)''' = Floor 2 is specifically for Old Blue Box and Old Purple Box farming, Floor 6 is for Crimson Bows and Floors above 6 are very hard to farm especially with the presence of the "of Thanatos" mobs. If you ever got strong enough, you can easily farm Floors above 6 and can even rival that of Gefenia.



== Gameplay and Trivia ==

* If you are in a party, even if you are a DPS build, always have Devotion for your main Tank and Supports! This makes the run easier and makes the Arch Bishop's role easier especially in healing. 

* If you have other Royal Guards in the party, always communicate and try to persuade them into Skill Resetting for Banding. Its a very powerful buff that is unique to Royal Guards. It will give you a lot of ATK, DEF, HP and recovery. It will also give you access to "Banding Only" skills such as Hesperus Lit and Ray Of Genesis (which can also be used if you are under the effects of Inspiration).

* Gospel and Inspiration will remove all positive and negative buffs on cast.

* Sometimes, it's better to just use Gospel on the party's main DPS as they can receive increased stats and double damage.

* Shield Spell buffs doesn't wore off even if you remove the equipped shield.

* Always have a Rosa Shield[1] in your inventory as it gives the most ATK from Shield Spell Level 1.

* Shield Spell Level 2 can cast Magnificat. Just make sure that the shield you are wearing has MDEF.

* Force of Vanguard is cancelled when you use King's Grace.

* Overbrand has no cooldown if you are under the effects of Poem Of Bragi making it your best DPS skill in party situations.

* Pinpoint Attack is considered as a long range attack. It can be blocked by Pneuma and the leap effect doesn't work in WoE.

* Rage Counters from Force Of Vanguard doesn't miss thus making Overbrand knockback enemies with it. If enemies have high FLEE (or activated Increase AGI) use Overbrand to knock them back to the wall to deal damage (collision damage cannot miss). Effective against Suffering Khalitzburg at Old Glast Heim. It has a lot of practical uses, that is just one of them. ;)

* King's Guard makes EVERYONE outside of PvP be invulnerable and do nothing for the duration, making it a good way to "steal" or "secure" an MVP for a friend or guildmate.



== Leveling ==

The places that I will put in this section is mainly for solo players as I assume that most players that will read this is either new to the server or new to the class. If you are going with a party, there are other places that are better to start at. You can also check the [[Leveling Guide]]. 

=== Lv 1 - Lv 99 ===
* '''Lv 1 - Lv 12 Novice'''
** Just follow the Mini Tutorial with Captain Carocc. If you did it right, you can easily change Job at the Prontera Main Office after registering to the Criatura Academy.


* '''Lv 13 - Lv 45 Swordsman (even though you're a Spearsman)'''
** Go to Izlude and ask for the "Increase AGI Aco" NPC for Increase AGI (duh!) and warp to Payon Cave. (Have at least 20-30 DEX to be able to hit things and then go YOLO with STR to one hit monsters with BASH) After you have maxed both Bash and Increase HP recovery, go to the second floor and spam Bash on Soldier Skeletons and Archer Skeletons for more XP. Try to avoid Drainliar as they have high FLEE and Eggyra as they have high DEF. Do note that weak mobs now give Fly Wing, making it easier to navigate maps at early levels. Use the free Novice Potions for healing. They will give you tons so drink away! After reaching Level 45, I'm pretty sure that you are now able to change your Job into Crusader, so go back to Prontera's Main Office and change Job! Also, sell all the loots you get from Soldier Skeletons and Archer Skeletons (except for Archer Skeleton Card which you can sell to players for at least 5-7m depending on the demand) and get a Lance at the Weapons Shop (upper right side of the Prontera Fountain).


* '''Lv 45 - Lv 74 Crusader (Your journey as a Crusader)'''
** Go back to Payon Cave Floor 2 and Bash monsters until you get Holy Cross. At this moment, you can pretty much one shot all the mobs at Floor 3 thanks to your new Lance and Holy Cross (Holy Cross deals double the damage if the equipped weapon is a Two Hand Spear). Feel free to go to Floor 4 and 5 if you are confident that you can one shot monster with Holy Cross. Continue killing until you reach Level 74. You should have at least 50 DEX at this point to be able to hit monsters for the next step.


* '''Lv 74 - 87 Crusader (Ez Bugatti)'''
** At this level, go to Eden Headquarters and register to Secretary Lime Evenor. Talk to Instructor Ur and you should be given a quest at Glast Heim St. Abbey. Before teleporting there, go "talk" to Mission [71-85] and get the quests for hunting Evil Druid and Wraiths. After completing the quest Instructor Ur gives you, you will now be given Eden Equipment for you to use when doing Gramps! (In which will be your equipment until Level 125) '''NOTE!''': The quests the you got from Mission [71-85] should not be given in.


* '''Lv 87 - Lv 99 Crusader (The Struggle for Rebirth)'''
** Level range to join the first bracket of Gramps quests. Note that Gramps quests are rotated at the start of every month. You can also hunt them outside of Gramps map. Use the &lt;code>@whereis (monster name)&lt;/code> command to find out where a monster spawns. At this level (BTW, I suggest that you Stat reset and focus more on VIT and AGI since your main role here is to tank and lure), you should start Gramps by shouting in #lfg and look for potential members for your Gramps run. Don't forget to take the Gramps Quest located just left side of Gramps. Also, go up stairs and get all the Turtle Island quests from 86-90 Mission Board. '''Your main role for Gramps is a lurer via Provoke and tanking them for the DPS and AoE class to finish them off.''' Before you even finish the Gramps Quest, you will easily reach level 99, even so, stay and finish the Gramps Quest. After finishing the Gramps Quest, '''DO NOT TURN THEM IN! INCLUDING THE TURTLE ISLAND QUESTS!''' And Rebirth.


* '''Rebirth up to 3rd Job (Time To Be A Royal Guard!)'''
** After becoming a High Novice, go kill some Little Porings until you are able to change Jobs. 
** After becoming a High Swordsman (Spearsman), go do the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village Quest]. After completing the quest, you should be able to change Job into Paladin.
** After becoming a Paladin, this is now the time that you should turn in your Gramps Quest! If you are short on 1 Job Level, you can either go in and kill some mobs OR turn in one of the Turtle Island Quests and ask for more Job EXP to be able to change your Job into a Royal Guard.



=== Lv 100+ ===

* '''Lv 100 - Lv 114 (The Awakening)'''
**Just continue doing Gramps until you reach Level 145. AS SOON AS POSSBILE, GET OVERBRAND! So that you can also start farming for your equips. You should also start doing pre requisite quests for [[Wolfchev's Laboratory]]. You can start with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Biolabs_Entrance_Quest Biolab's Entrance Quest].
*** Minimum level to access [[Sara's Memory]] in which you will farm Stat Food for future use and [[Infinite Space]].


* '''Lv 115 - Lv 144 (OVERBRAND EVERYTHING)'''
** Level range to join the second bracket of Gramps quests.
** By the way, if you have just finished 85-114 Gramps Quest, you can immediately do the 115-144 Gramps quest.
** At this Level, you should be doing the second quest of the pre requisites for [[Wolfchev's Laboratory]] which is the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Factory_Quest Factory Quest].


* '''Lv 120 gives you access to'''
** [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] in which you can solo in the future! Feel free to look for parties that are doing this instance as it also gives a lot of EXP. 
** [[Ghost Palace]] in which should start doing ASAP everytime it is off cooldown. Farm your Thanatos Spear, after that, you can sell the Gray Shards to players for Zeny
*** I'm pretty sure that you can already start doing the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Einbroch_Murder_Quest Einbroch Murder Quest] since you've just finished doing the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Factory_Quest Factory Quest].


* '''Lv 125 gives you access to'''
** [[Airship Assault]] in which you will get your first upgrade of equipments! You can solo this, just make sure to bring some consumables or duo with an Arch Bishop that you can Even Share with.
*** Now that you've just finished doing [[Einbroch Murder Quest]], it's time to start [http://irowiki.org/wiki/President_Quest President Quest] at least up to Step 9 if you're not in the right time, you can start doing [[Cursed Spirit Quest]]. 


* '''Lv 130'''
** Minimum level to access [[Old Glast Heim]] Normal Mode in which you can ask #lfg for potential party members. If you are going to tank, make sure that you have a Valkyrja's Shield with Alice card, Manteau of Airship with Raydric Card and Long Horn. Also, be sure to only use that Alice carded shield against MVPs or else normal monsters will rape you.


* '''Lv 140'''
** Minimum level to access [[Horror Toy Factory]], [[Central Laboratory]], [[Malangdo Culvert]], [[Bakonawa Lake]].
*** You must complete [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Bakonawa_Extermination Bakonawa Extermination] to access Bakonawa Lake.
** Minimum level to do [[Dimensional Travel]]. This is a pre-requisite quest to access [[Bios Island]].
*** I suggest that you start doing the pre requisites of these instances as this is the level wherein Gramps Quest only gives around 1-2 levels. Also a good time to be farming some of your equips or start doing the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dangerous_Rumors Dangerous Rumors Quest]. Do note that accessing [[Wolfchev's Laboratory]] requires you to be Level 150 and a pretty well geared party.


* '''Lv 145 - Lv 175'''
** Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests.
*** If you have just finished 115 - 144 Gramps Quest, immediately do the 145-175 Gramps!
*** At this point, your best way of leveling is joining [[Endless Tower]], [[Endless Cellar]] and [[Old Glast Heim]] Hard Mode in which you can join as a DPS and Devotion Slave.


== Tips ==
* Always use @whereis (monster id), @whosell (item id), @whobuys (itemd id)
* Don't be afraid to ask at #support. If nobody answers, ask the question at a later time
* Try to know the value of an item by asking in #trade
* Socialize! This is a multiplayer game not a single player game.
* Never be afraid to die for you party. They will appreciate you more whenever you use Devotion to die for them.
* Use divine-pride.net as it is more up to date that of ratemyserver.net
* Use the forums as a way of being up to date with patches or news in Nova Ragnarok
* Enjoy the game! If you are getting frustrated and tired, stand up, do some stretching, eat something, watch a movie or sleep! You're suppose to have fun and not get angry when playing. :D
