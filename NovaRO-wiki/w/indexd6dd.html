== Overview ==

The Minstrel is a support class focused on buffing your teammates with AoE songs while inflicting crippling debuffs to your enemies. This guide focuses primarily on gameplay in a WoE/BG setting. If you do not know anything about War of Emperium and/or Battlegrounds, please read up on those topics before continuing reading this guide as I expect you to at least somewhat understand these game modes.

'''Pros:'''

*Bragi

'''Cons:'''

*Bragi

== Stats ==
For this section, I will tell you the what each stat does and let you decide the values you should invest.

If you do not know what some Status Effects do, look [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effect '''here'''] as iROwiki has a nice description of each status. However, some of the information in iROwiki about preventing certain statuses is not accurate to NovaRO. My guide here tells you the correct stats that prevent statuses.


*'''STR''' - Strength is used primarily for increasing ATK and Weight Limit. 
**Reduces the duration of being stuck inside [[File:Extreme_Vacuum.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Extreme_Vacuum Extreme Vacuum].
**Indirectly decreases the chance of being afflicted by [[File:Masquerade_Ignorance.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2294/masquerade-ignorance Masquerade]  because it's success chance is based on the target's Total Weight Limit - Current Weight Limit.


*'''AGI''' - Agility is primarily used for increasing Attack Speed and Flee. 
**Attack Speed is important because it affects Animation Delay, which is basically the amount of time it takes your character sprite to stop moving after they finished casting a Skill, and in turn, letting you use another skill. 
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by [[File:Masquerade_Ignorance.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2294/masquerade-ignorance Masquerade] Skills.
**Decreases chance of being immobilized by [[File:Warg_Bite.png]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Warg_Bite Warg Bite].
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by Sleep and Bleeding.
NOTE: You should have high AGI to increase the effectiveness of Assassin Cross of Sunset.


*'''VIT''' - Vitality is primarily used for increasing Max Health.
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by Poison (not GX poisons), Stun, and Blind.
**Reduces Freezing(Not Frozen) duration.
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by [[File:Mandragora_Howling.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2492/mandragora-howl Mandragora Howling]
**Reduces [[File:Diamond_Dust.png]] Crystallization duration.
NOTE: You should have high VIT to increase the effectiveness of Apple of Idun.



*'''INT''' - Intelligence is primarily used for increasing Max SP.
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by Silence .
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by Oblivion Curse .
**Reduces [[File:Marsh_of_Abyss.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2205/marsh-of-abyss Marsh of Abyss] duration.
**Reduces Deep Sleep duration.
**Reduces [[File:Arrullo.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Arrullo Arrullo] success chance.
**Reduces Variable Cast Time.
NOTE: You will need to run a build with 150 INT total for 0 Cast Delay on your Poem of Bragi.


*'''DEX''' - Dexterity is used primarily for increasing Accuracy.
**Reduces chance to be Stripped.
**Reduces Freezing duration.
**Reduces [[File:Stasis.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2209/stasis Stasis] duration.
**Reduces Variable Cast Time.


*'''LUK''' - Luck is primarily used for increasing CRIT chance, Perfect Dodge, Accuracy, and ATK.
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by Curse.
**Reduces [[File:Marsh_of_Abyss.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2205/marsh-of-abyss Marsh of Abyss] duration.
**Decreases chance of being afflicted by [[File:Masquerade_Ignorance.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2294/masquerade-ignorance Masquerade].
**Note that 3 points in LUK increases ATK and Hit by 1 where 1 point in STR or DEX increases ATK and Hit by 1 respectively.

== Equipment ==
Let me start by saying: You do not need '''every single item''' listed here. The items listed help you in certain match ups. However, they are not completely mandatory to success. Also, don't carry all your equipment with you at once. Grab what you need from storage and put in whatever you don't.

The equipment I display focus mainly around Elements. This is because a key mechanic in Ragnarok Online is playing around Elements. The Elements Table can be found [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Element here]. Some notes to take from this table is that using an Elemental Armor puts you at Level 1 of that Element. This means you will take less damage from the corresponding Element as well as take more damage from its opposing Element. Another thing to note is that since you are using an Elemental Armor, you are no longer Neutral Element; this means that Ghost property attacks will do full damage to you.

As a minstrel, your job is to stay alive and support your team. These gears focus on maximizing your survivability and/or ability to support your team.

||Armor
||[[Guild Dungeon Investment System]]
||Simply the best Armor for reduction, there is no current alternative to using another body armor. The 15% Ranged Resist at +6 is invaluable as well as the 25% total Demihuman reduction when using the full WoE Set. If a +9 is out of your budget, a +6 should suffice for a long time.

*'''Song Flashing'''

Song Flashing is a technique minstrel players use to quickly turn off a song to make another action without the usage of Adaption to Circumstances. To song flash, play a song then turn it off by switching your weapon.

*'''Ensembles'''

Ensembles are group songs that you can only be performed when there is a Wanderer in your party.

*'''Group A Songs'''

Group A Songs are a list of song buffs/debuffs that can only be applied one at at time. This means you can overwrite a Group A song with your own song.

*'''Group B Songs'''

Group B Songs are a list of song buffs/debuffs that can only be applied one at a time. This means you can overwrite a Group B song with your own song.
''NOTE'' Deep Sleep status effect counts as a Group B Song.

*'''Choruses'''

Choruses are group songs that can only be performed when there is another Performer (Minstrel/Wanderer) in your party.

== Gameplay ==

General gameplay for a minstrel is to keep Frigg's Song, Poem of Bragi, Apple of Idun, and Assassin Cross of Sunset up on your allies 24/7 while debuffing your enemies with Harmonize and Poem of Netherworld. Aside from this, it's also your responsibility to cure certains debuffs on your allies:  such as use Echo Song/Windmill Rush when an ally is affected by Harmonize, using any Group B Song on your allies when they're affected by Deep Sleep / Siren's Voice, and using Iara Card / Status Recovery when an ally is Stone Cursed/Frozen/Statis-ed. Because Harmonize, Siren's Voice, and Stasis does not have a status effect to indicate their effect, you must watch enemy Minstrels and Warlocks for Harmonize/Siren's Voice and Stasis respectively. Because it‚Äôs nearly impossible to watch every enemy, you should also keep an eye on your teammates; if they‚Äôre casting slow, it usually means they‚Äôre harmonized and you need to cure it for them.

{| class="wikitable"
! style="width:12%" |'''Class'''
!'''Notes'''
|-
|'''Super Novice'''
| Useless class that can and should be ignored.
|-
|'''Oboro/Kagerou'''
|Oboro/Kagerous usually run a magic build relying on a ton on attack speed and instant cast to deal consistent single target DPS. Counter them by simply using Harmonize on them followed by Poem of Netherworld. Make sure to Siren's Voice if you notice them targeting you.
|-
|'''Rebellion'''
|Rebellions typically use Slug Shot to deal strong single target burst damage. Counter them by simply using Harmonize on them. Poem of Netherworld isn't particularly useful as they can Fallen Angel away. Make sure to Hide or Siren's Voice if you're being targeted by them.
|-
| '''Rune Knight'''
|| Rune Knights run either a Crush Strike or Dragon Breath build. You should mainly try to Poem of Netherworld them and do your best to not let them get in range to steal Bragi or Crush Strike you. Then you can follow up with a Harmonize. You should also Siren's Voice if they're a Crush Strike Rune Knight running towards you.
|-
| '''Royal Guard'''
||Royals Guards are usually in the back as a Devo RG or in the front as an Overbrand RG. If they're a Devo RG, you can pretty much ignore them to focus other targets. If they're an Overbrand RG, try to Poem of Netherworld them for the same reasons as the Crush Strike RK above. Harmonize and Siren's Voice isn't particularly useful unless they're spamming Banishing Point.
|- 
| '''Warlock'''
|| Warlocks will either be in the back casting long range skills or in the front preparing to run in to use a big AoE skill such as Stasis and/or Jack Frost. If they're too far in the back, it's usually too hard to Harmonize them therefore you should try to ignore them. If they're in the front, try to Poem of Netherworld to prevent them from going deep inside of your stack.
|-
|'''Sorcerer'''
|Sorcerers focus on casting a large amount of skills with intent to debuff enemies. Because this class has a huge amount variable cast skills, they are a high priority target to Harmonize. It's usually waste of time snaring a Sorcerer with Poem of Netherworld since they don't move often from their Wall of Fog. Siren's Voice is also ineffective since most Sorcerer skills focus on being AoE.

|-
| '''Ranger'''
|| Rangers mainly try to poke with large AoE DPS in the form of Arrow Storm. Since they go for a hit and run strategy, try to snare them with Poem of Netherworld. Harmonize is ineffective against Rangers since they don't rely too much on their stats. Siren's Voice to prevent them from casting Warg Strike and Arrow Storm on you.
|-
|'''Minstrel/Wanderer'''
|Wanderers will usually run into your stack to Slow Grace your team. Try to snare them with Poem of Netherworld before they can get close enough to harm your team. Harmonize is inefficient since they can cure them self of the debuff easily. Siren's Voice is also inefficient because it gets overwritten by their own Group B Song.
|-
|'''Arch Bishop'''
|Arch Bishops are usually in the back preventing statuses from affecting their allies. Since they're far in the back, immobile, and don't really target enemies, it's usually best to just ignore this class and focus on other enemies.
|-
|'''Sura'''
|Suras will either do single target DPS with Gate of Hell or immobilize your team with Cursed Circle. Since they're heavily reliant on ASPD, try to Harmonize them while they're snapping around as it'll be very hard to properly target them when they're inside your team. Siren's Voice is also useful against a DPS GoH Sura snapping too close to you. Poem of Netherworld is pretty much useless since Suras move around with snap usually.
|-
|'''Mechanic'''
|Mechanics typically deal consistent single target DPS with Arms Cannon. Harmonize and Gloomy Shyness is very potent as they rely on ASPD and cast time. Poem of Netherworld is ineffective as Mechanics have access to Front and Back Sliding to run away. Siren's Voice is useful if you find that the Mechanic is targeting you. 
|-
|'''Genetic'''
||Geneticists usually run to your team to cast a plethora of debuffs on them. Before they're able to get in close, try to snare them with Poem of Netherworld as well as Harmonize them as most all of their skills rely on variable cast time. Siren's Voice isn't very useful since their skills focus on targeting the ground than you.
|-
|'''Guillotine Cross'''
|| Guillotine Crosses need to get in close to you and your team to deal damage. Make sure to keep Maya Purple or Box of Sunlights up at all time. Since they have to get in close to do anything, just Poem of Netherworld them. Harmonize isn't a priority on them since they don't spam skills or have cast time. Siren's Voice is also useful if you assume the GX is targeting you.
|-
||'''Shadow Chaser'''
|Shadow Chasers specialize in jumping in your team with Flying Side Kick to afflict you and your team with debuffs. Try to Harmonize them before they jump in your stack as it'll be very hard to target them once they're inside. When they're inside Poem of Netherworld on yourself and allies to snare chasers when they jump onto your team. Make sure to Siren's Voice to prevent them from targeting you.
|-
||'''Doram'''
| Dorams typically Lope in to spam Picky Peck on you and your team. Dorams are heavily reliant on ASPD so try to Harmonize them when they Lope in. Afterwards try to snare them with Poem of Netherworld. Make sure to Siren's Voice if they're targeting you.
