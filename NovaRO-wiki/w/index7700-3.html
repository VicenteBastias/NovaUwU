Renewal is a comprehensive system-wide revamp that was implemented on Ragnarok Online in 2010. This guide will help you to understand the difference between Pre-Renewal and Renewal mechanics, so that you can adapt quickly to the mechanics used on NovaRO.

If you're completely new to Ragnarok Online, check out our '''[[Introduction to Ragnarok Online]]''' page. If you're familiar with Renewal, but new to our server, check out our '''[[Introduction to NovaRO]]''' page. Lastly, if you can't find the answer to your questions here, try the''' [[Getting Started]]''' page.


== Game Mechanics ==
Some of the most significant changes that was brought with the Renewal update has to do with Game Mechanics. This includes Jobs, Levels, Stats, and several Substats.

=== Third Job ===
The biggest change brought by Renewal is the addition of [[:Category:Class_Guides|third job classes]] and the increase of the base level cap to 200 and job level cap to 70. With new job classes come new skills, which open doors to new play-styles for each job class. 

In NovaRO, the [[Alternative Outfits]] for some of these jobs are purchasable from the Stylist.

&lt;/gallery>

=== Stats ===
The entire stats system has been revamped. With the higher Level cap, the cap for max stats were also raised up to 130. The increase in availaIble stat points allows true hybrid classes to be made. Below is a short description of each Stat with comparison to Pre-Renewal mechanics, if applicable.
* '''STR:''' For melee weapons, every point in STR increases ''StatusATK'' by +1 and ''WeaponATK'' by 0.5%. For ranged weapons, every 5 points in STR increases ''StatusATK'' by +1. Each point of STR also adds +30 Weight Limit. The bonus ATK per 10 STR for melee weapons is no longer applied. 
* '''AGI: '''Every point in AGI adds +1 Flee and increases ''ASPD. ''Additionally, every 5 points in AGI adds 1 ''SoftDEF''. 
* '''VIT: '''Every point in VIT adds +1% MaxHP, +2% HP Healing Item effectiveness, and +1% resistance to several status effects. Every 2 points in VIT adds +1 ''SoftDEF''. Every 5 points in VIT adds +1 ''SoftMDEF'' and +1 HP Recovery Rate. 
* '''INT: '''Every point in INT adds +1.5 ''StatusMATK'', +1% MaxSP, 1% SP Healing Item effectiveness, and decreases cast time. Every 2 points of INT adds +1 ''SoftMDEF'' and every 6 points in INT adds +1 SP Recovery Rate. The multiples of 5 and 7 bonus for ''minMATK'' and ''maxMATK'' is no longer applied. 
* '''DEX: '''For ranged weapons, every point in DEX increases ''StatusATK'' by +1 and ''WeaponATK'' by 0.5%. For melee weapons, every 5 points in DEX increases ''StatusATK'' by +1. Every point in DEX also adds +1 HIT, decreases cast time, and increases ASPD. Every 5 points in DEX adds +1 ''StatusMATK'' and +1 ''SoftMDEF''. The bonus ATK per 10 DEX for ranged weapons is no longer applied.
* '''LUK:''' Every point in LUK adds +0.3% Critical Hit Rate, as well as resistance to several status effects. Every 3 points in LUK adds +1 ''StatusATK, ''+1 ''StatusMATK, and ''+1 ''HIT. ''Every 5 points in LUK adds +1 Flee and +1% Anti-Critical Rate, and Every 10 points in LUK adds +1 Perfect Dodge.

=== Substats ===
Aside from Stats, several Substats were also drastically changed. Most of these define the main difference between Pre-Renewal and Renewal Mechanics.

==== ATK ====
In Renewal, the Attack Power(ATK) is divided into two, ''StatusATK ''and ''WeaponATK''. In essence, they both contribute to the final damage (StatusATK being multiplied by two). However, when amplified by racial/size/elemental bonuses (such as Hydra Card or Skeleton Worker Card), only the WeaponATK is amplified. This makes it so that people no longer rely on 4-slotted starter weapons (such as a Quad-Racial Composite Bow), and instead will strive to get higher level weapons with higher ATKs and Refine rates to deal better damage.

==== MATK ====
As with ATK, Magical Attack Power(MATK) is also divided into two, ''StatusMATK'' and ''WeaponMATK''. With the introduction of this update, many weapons now possess a flat MATK number (e.g. 280 MATK from Staff of Destruction; 105 MATK from Bazerald). In MATK's case, ''WeaponMATK'' makes up the greater percentage of the final damage, due to the variance factor which relates to weapon level.

==== DEF/MDEF ====
The Defense(DEF) and Magical Defense(MDEF) system was revamped in the Renewal Update. ''HardDEF/MDEF'' is no longer limited into a 1-100 point system, with 100 being full immunity. Instead, the effect of ''HardDEF/MDEF'' is now reduced exponentially as the number goes up (i.e. the higher the number, the less effect every single point adds); and in DEF's case, the number often goes way beyond 100. For example, 200 ''HardDEF'' gives about 25% damage reduction, and 400 ''HardDEF'' gives about 40% damage reduction. As for MDEF, 20 ''HardMDEF'' gives about 15% damage reduction, and 40 ''HardMDEF'' gives about 25% damage reduction. With this change, many armor have had their DEF number raised significantly (e.g. 85 DEF from Meteo Plate Armor; 16 DEF from Naght Sieger's Flame Manteau; 120 DEF from Sacred Mission) to match the new DEF calculation system. 

''SoftDEF/MDEF'' which is mostly based on VIT and INT respectively, did not go through a lot of change from Pre-Renewal. They reduce damage subtractively, removing flat amounts from the final damage after the ''HardDEF/MDEF'' reductions are applied.

==== Critical ====
Critical hits had been slightly altered in Renewal. Critical hits still ignore FLEE, but it does not ignore DEF anymore. Instead, it will deal 40% more damage by default. Additionally, more items provides Critical Damage bonuses, which means with the right combination of equipment and cards, it's possible to deal 200% your regular damage per critical hit, or even higher.

==== Cast Time ====
One of the most significant changes that happened with the Renewal update was Cast Time. It is now split into ''Fixed'' and ''Variable'' Cast Time (''F''CT and ''V''CT).

The Fixed Cast Time part is not affected by Stats, and can only be reduced by special means (e.g. Arch Bishop's Sacrament or Temporal DEX Boots). Not all skills have a Fixed Cast Time, but the addition of Fixed Cast Time disallows skills like Acid Demonstration and Asura Strike to be cast instantly; thus offering balance in PvP.

Variable Cast Time, on the other hand, is similar to the Cast Time in Pre-Renewal. The main difference is that it is no longer reduced only by DEX, but also by INT. Variable Cast time can be completely eliminated if (DEX x 2 + INT) = 530.

[[File:IntroCDelay.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cast Delay display in Hotbar]]
==== Delay ====
Delay is a relatively obscure mechanic that was mostly ignored in Pre-Renewal. In Renewal, however, it can be separated into two: Cast Delay and Cooldown. 

''After-cast Delay'' (ACD, also known as Cast Delay or Global Cooldown) is a delay that prevents all skills from being cast. Some skills, such as Magnificat, have longer Cast delay, while others have shorter ones. This delay can be reduced by certain equipment like Expert Ring and Kiel D-01 Card, and by a Bard's Poem of Bragi skill.

On the other hand, ''Cooldown'' (CD, also known as Hard Cooldown) is a delay that prevents certain single skills from being recast immediately. Not all skills have Cooldowns, but some, such as a Sura's Asura Strike, have a long Cooldown. This Cooldown is not affected by Poem of Bragi, and is only affected by very specific items, for example: Tornado Axe reduces the cooldown of Mechanic's Axe Tornado, and Bow of Storms reduces the cooldown of Maestro/Wanderer's Severe Rainstorm.

=== Battlestats Command ===
[[File:Battlestats.png|200px|thumb|right|Battlestats Message in Chat Log]]
The &lt;code>@battlestats&lt;/code> / &lt;code>@bs&lt;/code> command is a NovaRO exclusive [[Player Command]]. You can use this command while in-game to get a summary of your character's substats, including Offensive and Defensive capability; ASPD calculation; Accuracy and Flee; Crit chance and Crit Damage; Cast Time and Cast Delay; as well as bonuses and penalties related to each of the aforementioned substats.
&lt;br clear=both>

== Gameplay ==

=== Beginning ===
__NOTOC__When you begin playing, you create your Novice character. You are no longer required to put initial stats, nor are you spawned in the Training Grounds map anymore. Instead, you spawn in a ship, heading towards Izlude, with 1 in each stat. You will then be able to follow a series of tutorial quests at the Criatura Academy, located in Izlude.

When you have finished the training and reached Job level 10, you may change into your first job. Changing into first job classes, except Taekwon Kid, Ninja, Gunslinger, and Super Novice, do not require quests anymore. In NovaRO, job changing may be done with the Job Master NPC located in the [[Main Office]] Building in Prontera (/navi prontera 135/185).

After you've become a first job, you may begin your journey towards level 99.

=== Leveling up to 99 ===
''See Also: [[Leveling Guide]], [[Eden Group]] and [[Eden Academy]]''

The Renewal update implemented an organisation called the [[Eden Group]].
They offer quests which rewards players with equipment and experience for leveling during the early levels.
In NovaRO, the Eden Group Headquarters can be accessed using the command &lt;code>@go eden&lt;/code>.
You may only access the Eden Group Quests after registering with the NPC named Secretary Lime Evenor.

==== Eden Academy ====
In NovaRO, a customised extended tutorial known as [[Eden Academy]] is implemented.
It goes beyond just basic game controls, and aims to better acclimate brand-new and returning players to the pacing of the server.
The Academy was designed to be a once-per-account experience.
Players that complete the main quest from the Academy unlock extra, optional lessons and an exclusive shop containing rewards obtained throughout the main quest and potions.

By registering to the Academy and being at least level 100, you'll be able to undertake a final assignment from Academy Headmaster Emme {{NaviLink|map=moc_para01|x=146|y=117}}
in order to obtain, refine and enchant Noblesse, Imperial and Grace class sets.
These class sets are early-mid game equipment that provides bonuses to certain skills, with two variants per class.
Upon completing this final assignment, you'll also be granted access to special shops, allowing you to freely exchange your set for its other variant, and buy extra sets for other classes.

You can register to the Academy by following the entirety of [[Mom|Mom's Tutorial]], or by heading to {{NaviLink|map=izlude|x=143|y=352}} and talking to Receptionist Jolene, inside the Academy main building.

==== Equipments Quests ====
'''''Note: These quests and equipments are principally superseded by the [[Eden Academy]] quests.'''''

The NPCs Instructor Boya and Instructor Ur in Eden Group HQ offers special equipment quests for new players. Instructor Boya gives them for levels 11-59, while Instructor Ur gives them for levels 60-100. The equipment set includes an armor, garment, shoes, hat and a selection of weapons which vary by job classes.

==== Board Quests ====
There are several boards located in Eden Group HQ, each labeled by a level range (e.g. "Level 11-26"). They give simple quests, such as killing 30 ea of monsters or collecting 30 ea of monster drops, and reward with hefty amounts of EXP. In NovaRO, there are board quests available for players up to level 185.

==== Gramps' Weekly Hunting ====
The [[Leveling Guide#Gramps| Gramps]] NPC in Eden Group HQ offers a special set of hunting quests. Each of them requires a 400 kill-count, and are grouped to levels 85-114, 115-144, 145-174 and 175-200. Additionally, the NPC grants access to a special map which is crowded with the to-be-hunted monsters. These quests are best done with a party, and reward with a huge amount of EXP when turned in.

=== Rebirth ===
The rebirth system is exactly he same as it was in Pre-Renewal. Characters who have reached the level cap of 99/50 may be reborn into a level 1/1 High Novice. The reborn character can then be leveled up again, with bonuses in MaxHP, MaxSP, and Stat points, to reach Transcendent 2nd Classes. In NovaRO, rebirth may be done with the Job Master NPC in Main Office. After you Rebirth, you may start leveling again up to 99/70 and gain access to Transcendent skills. 

=== Third Job ===
When you reach the level cap of your character at 99/50 or 99/70, you can change into the Third job class. Changing into the Third job will reset your Job level back to 1 and allow you to gain more levels, up to 200/70. The cap of your stats will also be raised to 130. Additionally, you will gain access to the third job skill tree with many new skills to use.

Leveling past 99 can be done through several means:

==== New World ====
The New World maps offers new challenges for characters beyond level 99. Gaining access to the New World opens ways to new quests, many of which are required to unlock new areas, dungeons, quests, as well as give access to new equipment choices. For example, the Two Tribes quest gives access to the Yggdrasil Dungeon, where you can fight the Nidhoggur's Shadow MVP; and the Lost Dragon Quest unlocks Mora Daily quests which allows you to get Mora Coins, exchangable for Class-specific Equipment.

==== Nightmare Dungeons ====
The Renewal update is also followed by the implementation of Nightmare Dungeons. These dungeons are special versions of existing dungeons, which has stronger mobs and new MVPs. Some examples of these are the Nightmare Pyramid Dungeon and Nightmare Clock Tower (also known as Twisted Time Tower).

==== Eden Group ====
The Eden Group is still a valuable ally for leveling past 99. The additional board quests for levels 100~175 can help guide you to places where you can grind for EXP, while rewarding you with bonus EXP after finishing the requirements. You can see a comprehensive guide for [[Eden Group]] here. Gramps' Weekly Hunting is also a viable choice for easy leveling with a party.

== Endgame ==

=== Heroes' Trails ===
''Main Article: [[Instances]]''

Heroes' Trails is a 3-part update which introduced several new instances based on the original Ragnarok Manhwa. Some of them, like, [[Ghost Palace]] and [[Geffen Magic Tournament]], must be done Solo; while others, like Sara's Memory and Faceworm's Nest, are done in a party.

Most of these instances reward players with exclusive, endgame-worthy equipment, such as Giant Faceworm Skins and Thanatos Weapons.

=== Other Instances ===
Aside from Heroes' Trails, there are also instances like [[Endless Tower]], [[Old Glast Heim]], Wolfchev's Laboratory, and the Port Malaya Instances. A few of these are very challenging, even for the best PvE players. However, most of them are very rewarding, giving players access to equipment such as [[Temporal Boots]], [[Biolab Gear|Biolab-exclusive equipment]], and [[Pintados Festival|Agimat Tattoos]].

=== Battlegrounds ===
The [[Battlegrounds]] system (BG) is a series of PvP games available to players level 150 and above. They reward players with Badges, which can be exchanged for PvP-oriented equipment. Players who join BG will be split randomly into teams, and must fulfil certain objectives to win, depending on the game mode. In NovaRO, the game modes include Triple Inferno, Capture the Flag, Stone Control, Conquest, and Krieger von Midgard. 

=== War of Emperium ===
The War of Emperium system (WoE) is Ragnarok Online's most defining feature. As with Pre-Renewal, WoE is the de facto Endgame for most players. It is a structured PvP revolving around the Guild system, where Guilds compete against each other to conquer castles. With the introduction of third job classes and their new skills, the WoE metagame has evolved into a more balanced state, where every class has a purpose in WoE.

=== Monster Hunting ===
The [[Monster Hunter]] instance (MH) is a custom feature available only in NovaRO. It is a PvM instance where players can gather into a party of up to 5 people, and choose a specific monster to hunt. All of the monsters are extremely strong, so that it requires strategy, coordination, and high damage per second (DPS) to be able to kill them. These monsters drop special loots, which can be used to forge Shadow Gear - which offer a small boost to the player's stats -, or into Monster Coupons which can be exchanged for MH-exclusive goods.
