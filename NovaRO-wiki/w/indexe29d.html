'''WIP'''
== Overview ==
Holders of the secret way of infusing Runes with power, the Rune Knights came back from Ash Vacuum to utilize their magic to restore order in Rune-Midgard. One of the most versatile classes, with the highest Base HP, able to fill almost every role your party need. Personally, I've been playing as Swordsman since the end of bRO closed beta, and stil have both my Rune Knight and Royal Guard there. Moved by the lack of a more generic Rune Knight guide, I decided to make one with the collected information I've got through another guides, wikis and forums, my personal point of view and the help of my guild. Please, feel free to comment and discuss, there is always room to improvement! This guid will be, initially, only PvM. If anyone wants to add PvP/WoE info I would be really grateful.

== Stats ==
{| class="wikitable" width="90%"
! style="width:100px" |Stat
! style="width:32%" |Function
!Notes
|-
!STR 
|
* '''1 Point''': StatusATK+1 and WeaponATK+0.5% for melee weapons. Weight Limit+30.

* '''5 Points''': StatusATK+1 for ranged weapons.

* '''Status Resistance and Duration''': Helps to resist against ''Break. ''Reduces the duration of player inflicted ''Imprison ''and ''Extreme Vacuum''.
|One of the main stats for RKs. Even when playing Full Dragon Breath you may want some points on it to help you with Weight Limit. For every other build is the most, or second most, important attribute.
|-
!AGI 
|
* '''1 Point''': Flee+1 and increases your ASPD
* '''5 Points''': SoftDEF+1
* '''Status Resistance and Duration''': Each point reduces the chance of ''Bleeding'' and ''Sleep ''in 1%. Reduces the duration of ''Masquerades,'' ''Break ''and ''Burning.''''' '''
* While it doesn't affects your Cast Speed, it reduces your animation delay, allowing you to link skills easier.
|ASPD, Flee, SoftDEF and protection against some annoying ailments. With 60 points in Agility, you'll get rid of animation delay and will add a good resistance against bleeding and sleeping. Personally, I like to have at least 80 total AGI when I'm not playing an AutoCast or Critical build. Try to keep your '''total''' AGI as a multiple of five to receive the SoftDEF bonus.
|-
!INT 
|
* '''1 Point''': Status MATK +1.5, Max SP +1%, SP Recovery Item +1%.
* '''2''' '''Points''': SoftMDEF+1. If INT>120, SP Recovery Rate+1.
* '''6''' '''Points''': SP Recovery Rate+1
* '''Status Resistance and Duration''': Each point reduces the chance of ''Blind ''in -2/3%'','' ''Sleep ''in -1%'' ''and'' Chaos ''in -2/3%. Reduces the duration of ''Sleep ''in -1/15s''.''''' '''
* Together with DEX it reduces the Variable Casting Time (TotalDEX*2+TotalINT=530 to eliminate it)
|One of the vital stats in a Full DB build, there is no thing as too much INT. It not only increases your damage output via {{Skill List |id=2001 |skill=Enchant Blade |simple=yes}}, but will also gives you enough SP to spam-cast your favorite skills!  
|-
!VIT 
|
* '''1 Point''': MHP+1%, HP Recovery Item +2%. 
* '''2''' '''Points''': SoftDEF+1. 
* '''5''' '''Points''': SoftMDEF+1, HP Recovery Rate+1
* '''Status Resistance and Duration''': Each point reduces the chance and duration of ''Stun, Poison and Deadly Poison ''(-1% of being affected) and reduces the duration of ''Burning, Freezing ''and ''Crystallization ''in 0.1s. There are also the status ''Blind, Curse, Howling ''and'' Stasis ''that I found being affected in their duration and success by VIT, but didn't found the values.
|Among the rules of nature and physics in the universe of Rune-Midgard there is one known as "Swordsmen will use VIT". You'll want at least 90-100 to have a nice amount of HP and resistance to some ailments. Personally, I always use at least 100 VIT to feel safe and sound while soaked in &lt;s>my own blood&lt;/s> the blood of my enemies. Multiple of five to get the SoftMDEF and increase your HP Recovery.
|-
!DEX 
|
* '''1 Point''': StatusATK+1 and WeaponATK+0.5% for ranged weapons, HIT+1 and increases ASPD. 
* '''5''' '''Points''': SoftMDEF+1, MATK+1 and StatusATK+1 for Axes, Daggers,Maces and Spears.
* '''Status Resistance and Duration''': Each point reduces the chance of being afflicted by ''Divest ''and reduces the duration of ''Freezing ''and ''Stasis''.

* Together with INT, it reduces the Variable Casting Time (TotalDEX*2+TotalINT=530 to eliminate it)
|DEX will help you hit, increase your damage and, if you are planning to spam skills, you're going to need a lot of it to compensate the usual lack of INT in RK builds. Multiple of five to receive the extra damage if you are using Spears.
|-
!LUK 
|
* '''1 Point''': Critical Rate+0.3%. 
* '''3 Points: '''ATK, MATK, HIT+1. 
* '''5''' '''Points''': Flee+1, Crit. Hit Shield +1%.
* '''10 Points: '''Perfect Dodge+1
* '''Status Resistance and Duration''': Each point reduces the chance and/or the duration of ''Blind, Break, Curse, Deadly Poison, Frozen, Howling, Poison, Silence, Sleep, Stone Curse ''and ''Stun.''
|LUK is our ace in the sleeve to increase our damage and hit without spending too much. On top of that, crits and Perfect Dodge are always welcome when RNGesus allows. Multiples of three to get the damage buffs without spending more points in STR and DEX.
|-
|}

== Skills ==

=== Swordman Skills ===
Swordman is our base class. We're going to benefit from almost every skill, since they are majorly passive and support skills.

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% " | Skill
! style=" width: 70% " | Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2 |skill=Sword Mastery|simple=yes}}
|ATK+4~40 to One-Hand Swords and Daggers. Useful if you're planning to use One-Hand Quicken.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3 |skill=Two-Handed Sword Mastery|simple=yes}}
|ATK+4~40 to Two-Hand Swords. A good skill to max, since most of your skills and builds can ((and probably will)) use this kind of weapon. Remember that masteries only increase damage from skills that take the WeaponATK in the formula.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=4 |skill=Increase HP Recovery|simple=yes}}
|One of the most useful skills in the game, it will recover your HP while you're NOT MOVING every 10 seconds. It have a base HP Regen equal to 5~50 plus an additional of 0.2% to 2% of your MHP. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5 |skill=Bash|simple=yes}}
|It will hit 130%~140% of your ATK with an additional 5%~50% HIT bonus. While kinda weak, it is not that useless if you're fighting something with high FLEE rate.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=6 |skill=Provoke|simple=yes}}
|A taunt that increases the ATK of the opponent while decreasing their DEF. Not that useful since you can't taunt Undead and Boss monsters.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=7 |skill=Magnum Break|simple=yes}}
|On top of dealing a lot more damage than Bash (120%~300%), this skill will also give you a little damage boost. 20% of this skill damage is pseudo-Fire. That mean that even if you will inflict more damage based on resist, you still count as Neutral to Ghost Property.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=8 |skill=Endure|simple=yes}}
|One of the most useful skills in the game, Endure will protect you from the little stagger you receive with each blow.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=144 |skill=HP Recovery while Moving |simple=yes}}
|You receive half of your natural HP Recovery ((1/4 of ouy recovery while sitting)) while moving.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=145 |skill=Fatal Blow|simple=yes}}
|Give a small chance to your Bash stun. (5%~25%)
|-
| {{Skill List |id=146 |skill=Berserk|simple=yes}}
|While you're at less than 25% HP, you will receive the effects of a lv.10 Provoke. While you will lose some DEF, it's a nice buff to your ATK.
|-
|}

===  Knight Skills ===
Now we're talking! Knight is the moment you begin to feel like the Rune Knight you're going to be. We have our filler, and sometimes main, skills for our rotation!
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% " | Skill
! style=" width: 70% " | Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=55 |skill=Spear Mastery|simple=yes}}
|Similar to our Swords Masteries (4~40), but with additional damage if you are riding (1~10).
|-
| {{Skill List |id=56 |skill=Pierce|simple=yes}}
|One of my favorite single target skills, it will deliver more hits the bigger the target. The damage is 110%~200% and will hit Medium creatures twice and Large creatures 3 times. These hits have a boost in their Hit Rate (5%~50%) and will always come at once.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=57 |skill=Brandish Spear|simple=yes}}
|An AoE skill used only with spears AND riding, deals 120%~300% damage. It has a nice area, but the damage and limitations will take out some of its usefulness.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=58 |skill=Spear Stab|simple=yes}}
|Same damage progression as Brandish Spear, but instead of AoE it will add a knockback effect (6 cells). Good to get some space, cast Endure and run away.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=59 |skill=Spear Boomerang|simple=yes}}
|150%~350% of your attack, but now ranged (3~11 cells)!
|-
| {{Skill List |id=60 |skill=Two-Hand Quicken|simple=yes}}
|The main skill of ASPD builds using two-handed swords. It will add +30% in your ASPD, allowing you to reach easier 193 ASPD. The ASPD mechanics will be explained in the ASPD builds part. It will last up to 300 seconds.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=61 |skill=Counterattack|simple=yes}}
|A not so amazing counter skill. You will be left standing during 2 seconds and will block and strike back at your opponent with double your Critical Rate.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=62 |skill=Bowling Bash|simple=yes}}
|One of the most important filler skills you are going to have. It hits twice with 140%~500% your attack, in a 3x3 grid. With it you can push or pull enemies, using the gutter lines you can hit one son of a peco with other and BB will RESET your Ignition Break (a Rune Knight AoE skill) cooldown, allowing you to spam cast. The only downsize is the DEF cut you will receive while casting.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=63 |skill=Peco Peco Ride|simple=yes}}
|Mount a oversized chicken to get a 25% boost in your walking speed, get 1000 in your Weight Limit and ignore size damage modifier while using spears! You will lose half you ASPD while mounted tho.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=64 |skill=Cavalier Mastery|simple=yes}}
|Recover the ASPD you have lost with Peco Peco Ride here!
|-
| {{Skill List |id=495 |skill=One Hand Quicken|simple=yes}}
|The skill granted to you when Soul Linked. It has the same effects as Two-Handed Quicken, but for One-Handed Swords... just like the name implies.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=1001|skill=Charge|simple=yes}}
|There is no better way to throw yourself into the fray than crash landing with your oversized chicken. The damage and cast time increases based on how much distant you are.  
|-
|}

=== Lord Knight Skills ===
There is no reason to NOT trascend. 25% more HP and SP, 20 more skill points and some of the most important skills you're going to have.
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% " | Skill
! style=" width: 70% " | Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=355 |skill=Aura Blade|simple=yes}}
|This skill will add 20~100 MasteryATK to your weapon. This extra damage will ignore DEF, but not FLEE, and doesn't have property, allowing you to damage Ghost Property. This skill WILL benefit from ATK% cards, but not Concentration/Spear Dynamo. This skill is one of the most essential buffs in the majority of my builds, as I really like the idea of an additional 100 to my ATK for 120 seconds.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=356 |skill=Parry|simple=yes}}
|23%~50% chance to block a ranged or melee attack for up to 1 minute. While it staggers you everytime you block, it will work even if you are frozen or petrified.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=357 |skill=Spear Dynamo|simple=yes}}
|First and foremost, this skill will work even if you're using a dagger. Second, HIT buff (10~50)+Endure+ATK buff(5%~25%). If you want to hit something this buff is what you need, but be careful you will lose up to 25% of your DEF.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=358 |skill=Relax|simple=yes}}
|Sit down, chill and recover three times the normal amount if you're not overweight. If you're overweight, use your loot as pillows and now recover the normal amount.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=359 |skill=Frenzy|simple=yes}}
|One of the most iconic Lord Knight skills. Triple you MHP and fill your HP, ASPD+30%, ATK+100%, no flinching and a little walking speed boost that only stacks with your Peco. Pretty amazing, but everything has a cost. SP set to 0 and for the duration of the skill (until you become with less than 100 HP) and 5 minutes more, drains 5% MHP every 15 seconds, set both your DEF and MDEF to 0 and halves your FLEE Rate, you're not going to be able to receive Heal and WON'T BE ALLOWED TO CHAT (@go 0), USE ITEMS, CHANGE EQUIPMENTS AND CAST SKILLS (even some Autocasted skills). Power does come with a cost, but with the right application in your strategy (from the greek strati̱gía) you will be able to deal all the damage that you want.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=397 |skill=Clashing Spiral|simple=yes}}
|Five hits based on the base ATK of the skill (150%~350%) and the weight of your weapon. The hits will be packed in one single strike, but they suffer a modifier based on the creature size (125% to Small, 100% to Medium and 75% to Large).
|-
| {{Skill List |id=398 |skill=Traumatic Blow|simple=yes}}
|A ranged attack that causes damage (140%~300%) and has a chance to inflict ''Bleeding'' in non-Undead and non-Boss monsters.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=399 |skill=Vital Strike|simple=yes}}
|A "low damage(10%~55%)/nice effect" skill, with the chance to stack and reset debuffs against the enemy.
|-
|}

=== Rune Knight Skills ===
Time to switch our oversized chickens for a beatiful and shiny LIZARD. I know it isn't any Smaug or Bahamut, but looks draconian enough for me.
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% " | Skill
! style=" width: 70% " | Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2001 |skill=Enchant Blade|simple=yes}}
| 120~200 of additional damage. Plus your own MATK. When well used, it can give you a lot of buffs, increasing up to 2k/hit to your damage.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2002 |skill=Sonic Wave|simple=yes}}
|600%~1000% ATK as ranged damage, with an extra boost in the damage based in your Base Level. This damage will reduce based on how further the wave traveled.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2003 |skill=Death Bound|simple=yes}}
|One of the most dangerous and useful tank skills you are going to have. Augment (600%~1500%) and reflect damage, while receiving part of the augmented damage.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2004 |skill=Hundred Spear|simple=yes}}
|Damage of 680%~1400% bundled in one hit, chance of autocasting Spear Boomerang if you've learnt it and being the inverse in terms of Weapon Weight, Hundred Spear is my second favorite skill in the Rune Knight Tree, losing only to the Rhydo Rune Crushing Strike.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2005 |skill=Wind Cutter|simple=yes}}
|A small AoE knockback skill, dealing 150%~350%, with up to 13% of chance to inflict ''Fear'' in the target.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2006 |skill=Ignition Break|simple=yes}}
|One of the best AoE skills you can use with your Ferus by your side. 300%~1500% to closer enemies, with additional damage if your weapon property is Fire.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2007|skill=Dragon Training|simple=yes}}
|Enough with the oversized chicken, that you will lose if you become a Rune Knight. IT'S FERUS TIME! MORE WEIGHT LIMIT! SAME ASPD LOSS ((that you will recover spending points in this skill))! GREENY AND SCALLY! YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND!
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath|simple=yes}}
|Make your new best friend spit fire and hate while burning the enemies! Damage based on your CURRENT HP and SP!
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2009 |skill=Dragon Howling|simple=yes}}
|56%~80% of chance to inflict ''Fear'' in an enormous area around you, usually blocking your movement for sometime.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery|simple=yes}}
|Not only my favorite skill, but the reason we uphold the Rune Knight legacy. Runes to deal a lot of damage? Check. Runes to heal HP, SP and cure status? Check. Sweet buffs and protections? Check. A way to share it with our party? Double Check A way to make your basic hit deal 5x to 20x more damage each hit? Triple Check. Utility and damage, allied with a nice flavor turns this my favorite skill and the reason I returned to play as RK after so much time playing as Royal Guard.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2020 |skill=Phantom Thrust|simple=yes}}
|Low damage (50%~250%) but the amazing ability of pulling an enemy or ally to you, range up to 9 cells.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5004 |skill=Dragon's Water Breath|simple=yes}}
|Same thing of Dragon Breath, but now with Water Property!
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5014 |skill=Full Throttle|simple=yes}}
|During 10~30 seconds you will receive a 20% buff in all your atributes and double your movement speed, while Full Throttle is active you will lose 6%~1% MSP each second. After the end of the effect you will be in ''Rebound'', being unable to naturally recover your HP and SP.
|-
|}

== Sweet Mechanics ==
Ok, there is a series of buffs and passives that I like to use to improve DPS and survivability, along with skills that require a little bit more attention or mechanics when used. Lets remember that some of these skills may require a specific weapon, and some will be only useful in specific builds. Here we're going to talk about their general interactions.
=== Buff and Skills Interactions ===
*Concentration will reset your 7-hit count during Endure, allowing you to chain up to 20 hits without flinching (6 from the first Endure, 7 from Concentration and 7 from the recasted without delay Endure).
* Increase HP Recovery will work even if you're attacking, while you not move everything will be fine.
* While under 25% MHP, the effect of the Berserk will kick in taking out 56% of your DEF but boosting your ATK in 32%.
* Provoke is useful if you can't spam Phantom Thrust.
* Ferus counts as Peco to Spear Mastery bonus damage.
* As Rune Knight you don't need to max Cavalier Mastery, since Dragon Riding already recovers your ASPD.
* Aura Blade will ignore your HIT and the enemy DEF, but he can still FLEE.
* Aura Blade and Spear Dynamo don't affect Clashing Spiral. 
* The runes only check the equipment in the moment they are activated.
* You can activate Nosiege Rune even under crowd control effects.
* Be careful when activating Parry and Counter, since you will stop whatever you are doing to block.
* Death Bound can kill you, try to use different levels of Death Bound to not die by the augmented damage.
* Bowling Bash will reset Ignition Break's delay, allowing you to spam-link them.
* Since the damage is calculated AFTER the knockback, Bowling Bash can pass Safety Walls.
* If you use the command /bbe you will see your gutter lines, a special area that will make you hit only one target (and he won't suffer any knockback). To get the most of your BB and understand more about gutter lines read THIS: http://www.juice.nl/invictus/doc/guide/bowling_bash/bowling_bash.html 
* Phantom Thrust can pull allies, without dealing damage to them.
* Lux Anima, the last rune you will learn to make, can pass the following skills to your party: Giant Growth, Vitality, Skin of Stone, Refresh and Millenium Shield.

=== Buff Rotation ===
To optimize your damage and SP usage I'm going to list here the duration of our buffs. Cast the longer first. 
* Enchant Blade - 5 minutes
* Two-Hand/One-Hand Quicken (Only 2H/1H swords) - 5 minutes
* Turisus Rune: Giant Growth - 3 minutes
* Isia Rune: Vitality Activation - 3 minutes
* Halagas Rune: Stonehard Skin - 3 minutes or the rune's HP reaches 0
* Asir Rune: Fighting Spirit - 3 minutes
* Urj Rune: Abundance - 3 minutes
* verkana Rune: Millenium Shield - 3 minutes
* Aura Blade - 2 minutes
* Parry (2H-Sword) - 1 minute
* Nosiege Rune: Refresh - 1 minute
* Spear Dynamo/Concentration - 45 seconds
* Full Throttle - 30 seconds
* Frenzy - HP > 100. This must be the last buff you use, because you can't cast while Frenzied

=== ASPD ===
Remember that our ASPD Cap is 193, so lets work with some values that we can add to help us max ASPD with less effort possible.
* Base ASPD 175/60 (AGI 0/AGI 120) - 159/182
* Two-Hand/One-Hand Quicken - +30%
* Frenzy - +30% but doesn't stack with 2H-Sword Quicken
* Fighting Spirit - Increases the buff based on how low is your ASPD
* Concentration/Awakening/Berserk potion - +10/+15/+20 %

=== Important Damage Formulas ===
====Clashing Spiral====
The damage increases based on your Weapon Weight plus a modifier based on the creature's size (125% to Small, 100% to Medium and 75% to Large).

Damage = (150%~350%) x [(WeaponWeight/2) x 1~5 + ATK]

====Dragon Breath====
Damage based on current HP, instead of MHP. Use of Hunter Fly and Rideword Hat is strongly recommended.

Damage = [(CurrHP ÷ 50) + (MaxSP ÷ 4)] × (SkillLv × BaseLv ÷ 150) × (95 + DragonTraining_Lv × 5)% × (100 + Ranged Damage Modifiers)% x (Elemental Modifiers)%

====Hundred Spears====
The damage increases the lighter your weapon, and then is modified based on your BaseLv.

Damage = [(680%~1400%) + (1000 - WeaponWeight)% + (ClashingSpiralLv x 50)%] x BaseLvMod ((100~150=100%~125%))

===Vital Strike===
As I said before, Vital Strike is more important for the debuffs it applies than for really dealing damage. Each time you apply a debuff they will not only stack, but reset the time they will affect the target.

BaseChance = 10%~55%

Chance of Effect = BaseChance − (Target_STR × 0.27)
Duration of Effect = [30 − (Target_AGI ÷ 10) − (Target_LUK ÷ 4)]s

Now that we have an idea of our chances to hit, let us check our random debuff lottery:
 {| class="wikitable"
!Joint Status!!Effect
|-
|Ankle Break||Halves Movement Speed
|-
|Knee Break||Decreases Movement Speed by 30% and ASPD by 10%
|-
|Wrist Break||Decreases ASPD by 25%
|-
|Shoulder Break||Halves SoftDEF
|-
|Waist Break||Decreases SoftDEF by 25% and ATK by 25%
|-
|Neck Break||Doubles damage from this skill, leaves vulnerable to Critical Hits and inflicts ''Bleeding''.

===Rune Mastery===
Ok, I could just copypaste the Rune Mastery page here, but instead I'll beg you to look at the link HERE>>https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Rune_Knight#Gameplay&lt;&lt;HERE to see how to make runes and what they can do. You can buy the initial base runes in the NPC beside the weapon shop in Prontera (prontera 168/288).

==Useful Item Sets and Weapons==
There are some items that we can use while not getting any of our final gear. They will, one way or another, help you to hold for your own while farming. Remember that our focus here is to keep you alive and help you to level up.

===Eden Set=== 
One of the best ways to early level up and to get some equipment is doing the Eden Group Quests. They will help you until you get new gear, but don't worry, since they do not have any set bonus you will keep enjoying their effects even trading  some pieces.

([https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Equipment_Quests Eden Group Equipment Quest])

* {{Item List |id=2571 |item=Eden Group Manteau II|simple=yes}}
* {{Item List |id=2473 |item=Eden Group Boots IV|simple=yes}}

===Goibne Set===
VIT+11, MDEF+13, DEF+5, MHP+30%, MSP+10%, reduce damage taken from long ranged attacks by 10%, +10% resistance to Water, Wind, Earth and Fire while using the full set. Even individually they are good and balanced gears that will increase your survivability.

== Builds ==
Now we're going to talk about builds and playstyles. I'll try to keep it as informative as I can, but if I'm mistaken feel free to correct me. Our item tiers are graduated in the crescent order "Meh", "Balanced", "Good" and "BiS".  
=== Dragon Breath ===
----
Dragon Breath allows you to deal damage while having enough HP to feel safe. Nowadays DB builds are more focused on being useful as tanks and supports while helping to clean up the way and spreading debuffs.Our plan is to deal as much damage with our DB as possible. Remember that you only deal damage with Fire and Water property and based on current HP, so leveling with this build is not that easy. Max DEX, INT, VIT and we're going to focus on getting near to insta-casting. Your skills are focused on helping you to deal neutral damage and not be so dependent of your main skill.

==== Dragon Breath Equipments ====
Our items are focused on survivability and increasing DB damage as much as possible. Lets focus on increasing HP, SP, boosting our sustain via leeching, increasing DEX, INT and VIt, and last but not least, decreasing our cast delay.

Not so strong as a solo piece but still a nice beginning, since it will add VIT and can be used together with sets that don't have Headgear.

If refined to +9 or higher, the HP and SP recovery is doubled. Since DB count as attack, it can recover your HP and SP with every breath you take, plus the sweet card slot that may be used to give us more HP or reduces our casting times.

|Reduces the cast delay of skills by 5%, reduces the SP cost of skills by 10%, reduces the cast delay of skills and the SP cost of skills by an additional 3% per 3 upgrade levels of the item. In my opinion, this is one the best headgears to DB because even if we are not increasing our damage, it stills reduces in a significant amount or cast delay and SP consumption.

This is, in my opinion, a vanity item to anyone playing as DB. It is just slightly better than Rideword Hat because it will not drain your HP and have a slightly better chance to proc the drains, but will drain less at the same refinement level.

|Drops from [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1706/maero-of-thanatos Thanatos Dolor]. It gives decent bonuses for a beginner - intermediate DB RK, especially when equipped with the whole set. Compared to {{Item List |id=15116 |item=Armor of Airship |simple=yes}}, it offers less overall HP and SP bonuses on full set, but Goibne's set provides much more element resist.

|&lt;center>Middle&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>Monster Drop from&lt;br>[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Airship_Assault Airship Assault]&lt;/center>
|Gives less HP than {{Item List |id=2354 |item=Goibne's Armor |simple=yes}} however, it provides better HP and SP bonus when equipped with its full set. It has a high level requirement though, which makes it a little harder to use early on.

|&lt;center>[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Battlegrounds Battlegrounds]&lt;/center>
|Straight up increasing 20% MHP and also 7% demi-human resist. Despite not having a slot, it is an already good armor for DB RK and fairly obtainable just by participating in some battleground matches (or wait out Valor Badges from [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Daily_Rewards Daily Rewards]).

|Not the most ideal armor out there. However, despite its small MHP and MSP boost, it provides an armor slot which is lacking on other DB RK armors. Aside from that, it also gives you a chance to autocast '''Lv. 10''' {{Skill List |id=28 |skill=Heal |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust |simple=yes}}. Heal autocast is not bad however, {{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust |simple=yes}} might backfire you if you do not have Bragi support / enough ACD reduction gears.

|&lt;center>[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Verus_Equipment_Exchange#Excellion_Set Verus Equipment Exchange]&lt;/center>
|Arguably the '''best''' armor for DB RK due to its potential on increasing max. HP. It can also be enchanted with {{Item List |id=6983 |item=HP Supplement Blueprint |simple=yes}} to further boost the max HP or even {{Item List |id=6985 |item=Frozen Supplement Blueprint |simple=yes}} to gain frozen immunity.

|&lt;center>Monster Drop&lt;/center>
|Drops from [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1076/skeleton Skeleton]. Knowing that DB RK does not benefit from ATK at all, a 4-slotted weapons are mostly a go-to choices. For this case, Mace has in-built indestructibility and has little ASPD penalty, which makes it ideal for DB build of any stage of the game. The effectiveness of this weapon depends on the cards you put inside it.

|&lt;center>[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Ghost_Palace Ghost Palace]&lt;/center>
|Similar reason to getting {{Item List |id=1505 |item=Mace | slots=4 |simple=yes}}, it has in-built indestructibility. What's more, Thanatos weapons also offer HP and SP leech capability that makes it preferable to use for some builds, especially DB RK.

== Leveling ==
Leveling places and tactics go here. To help you start, some of the relatively easier Eden Equipment Quests and the required levels of a number of instance dungeons have been added. This is mainly to help you as a writer, and you should adjust the level ranges in your guide with your own discretion.

For the higher level ranges, please also add other hunting and item collecting quests from Eden Quest Boards in addition to Gramps. This is so that your reader will know how to level while Gramps is on cooldown. Adding a few pointers about farming zeny is also recommended, for the fresh new players that may be reading your guide. Just be sure that your recommendations is actually doable for the class you're writing about; for example, you shouldn't tell a Full Support Arch Bishop to solo level and farm in Juperos.

Feel free to edit or remove parts of the template below as you see fit for your own guide, and remember to remove this text when you're editing.
