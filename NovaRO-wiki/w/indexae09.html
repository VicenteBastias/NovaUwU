= Overview =

Why hello there. I'm Yomi and some of you guys might know me ingame as Sara Bloodlily. I've decided to start a guide to introduce players into Trapper Ranger and more or less pass down my knowledge of everything I know about this particular build so far.

Before starting out on Nova, I was an avid Ranger player on officials, since Archer/Hunter was the first class I started playing in RO. I never really payed much attention to the trapping tree though and usually just went with Arrow Storm/Aimed Bolt or the Fear Breeze/Auto-Warg builds.

Coming to Nova, I wanted to try something different and did some reasearch on Trap Ranger before I decided to give this particular build a try.

Some people might think that it's not the most optimal build for the class. Having it played for several months now, I personally feel like it actually adds more versatility to the Ranger Class, since you'll be using it in some kind of combination with another skill tree anyway.

So, if you want to play something that deals high amounts of damage when wearing a bow and boasts of extreme tankiness when wearing a dagger and shield, be my guest and I'll tell you how.

= General Information about Traps =

Before we start out with the different builds and other stuff for Trapper Rangers, I'll give you an overview on how traps work on NovaRO. Some of this information is applicable for all traps, while other is specific to Hunter or Ranger traps.

== General Mechanics ==

All traps on NovaRO have or at least should have the following mechanics in common:

*Damage from traps is considered melee and physical 
*You can only place them every two sells ( {{Skill List |id=125 |skill=Talkie Box |simple=yes}} being the only exception here)
*Traps can be damaged by certain skills but not directly
*Traps can be knocked back by a select number of skills
*Traps cannot be removed by {{Skill List |id=288 |skill=Land Protector |simple=yes}} and even be placed on it to disturb or damage your enemies
*Traps can activate HP/SP drain effects from equipment like '''{{Card |id=4115 Hunter Fly Card}}''' and '''{{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |simple=yes}}'''
*Traps do not activate HP/SP drain effects from cards/equipment similiar to the '''{{Card |id=4279 Earth Deleter Card}}''', where you need to kill an enemy with a melee attack
*Traps do not activate effects like the '''{{Item List |id=4879 |item=Hawk's Eye |simple=yes}}''' enchantment from Temporal Boots
*Damage increasing buffs like {{Skill List |id=2537 |skill=Odin's Power |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=66 |skill=Impositio Manus |simple=yes}} will increase Trap damage slighly
*Traps last 4 times as long in WoE
*Traps will affect anyone during WoE/PvP so be careful when placing them since you can damage your allies
*If the caster is affected by {{Skill List |id=2299 |skill=Manhole |simple=yes}}, placed traps will not activate when walking through them

== Specific Mechanics ==

These trap mechanics are specific to their respective jobs or the traps you're using:

*Hunter Traps can be removed by any trap removal/destroying skills, while Ranger Traps cannot be removed/destroyed by {{Skill List |id=2483 |skill=Crazy Vines |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=131 |skill=Spring Trap |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=124 |skill=Remove Trap |simple=yes}}
*You can damage yourself with Hunter Traps during WoE/PvP. This does not apply to the Ranger Traps
*Ranger Traps (apart from {{Skill List |id=2239 |skill=Electric Shock |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2239 |skill=Cluster Bomb |simple=yes}}) can be placed directly under anyone while Hunter Traps can't
*Damage blocking skills like {{Skill List |id=356 |skill=Parry |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=249 |skill=Auto Guard |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2028 |skill=Weapon Blocking |simple=yes}} will work against Ranger Traps. Hunter Traps bypass these effects

== Trap Damage ==

Trap damage generally consists of
*the total ATK you have, which includes ATK from your weapon, ATK from upgrades, buffs or any direct ATK increases from cards or equipment
*your total INT as well as
*your total DEX

Each point into INT or DEX will increase your trap damage by ~16 at level 175 and with {{Skill List |id=2248 |skill=Trap Research |simple=yes}} maxed out, regardless of the equipment you're using. Each point of ATK you get will increase your trap damage by 1, which means that 16 ATK = 1 INT/DEX.

To elaborate further on this, we'll take a closer look at one of the main headgears for a Trapper on NovaRO, which is '''{{Item List |id=5898|item=Autumn Headband |slots=1 |simple=yes}}'''. This little baby increases trap damage for {{Skill List |id=2253 |skill=Fire Trap |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2254 |skill=Ice Bound Trap |simple=yes}} by 50% regardless of it's upgrade. If upgraded to +9, it will increase the damage dealt with those traps by another 25% for 75% total. This basically means that with no upgrade on it, you should get between 24-25 points of damage per INT/DEX and at +9 you'll get between 29-32 damage per INT/DEX. This will also affect your ATK-Value as well so for +7 it would be 1,5 ATK and for +9 1,75 ATK then.

You should therefore prioritize your equipment for PvM the following way to maximize your damage with traps:

*INT = DEX > Flat ATK > %ATK

Then there's also a slight difference in behaviour for Hunter Traps and Ranger Traps and in which way their damage is dealt:

This is the damage formula for {{Skill List |id=123 |skill=Claymore Trap |simple=yes}}:

&lt;code>[DEX × (3 + Base_Lv ÷ 100) × (1 + INT ÷ 35)] × Skill_Lv ± 10% + (Trap_Research_Lv × 40)&lt;/code>

This is the damage formula for {{Skill List |id=2253 |skill=Fire Trap |simple=yes}}:

&lt;code>ATK 100% + [{(Fire Trap Skill Level x Caster’s DEX) + (INT x 5)} x (1.5 + Caster’s Base Level / 100)] x {(Trap Research Skill Level x 20) / 100 }&lt;/code>

Here we can see the following:

*Ranger trap damage is divided into two parts instead of one. Because of this, Hunter Traps deal specific elemental damage, while Ranger Traps only deal "pseudo-elemental" damage
Now, Hunter Traps deliver the damage dealt in one total portion while Ranger Traps have two different portions in which damage is dealt to the target.

How does all of this information translate into pratical use?

Basically the reason why Hunter Traps will "miss" their target depending on their Element, is because their damage is dealt in one portion and will therefore always have the same element, whereas Ranger Traps deal their damage in two different portions and only one of these, the ATK-Portion, is affected by the traps element. This portion can and will miss depending on the element, but the Stat-Portion of Ranger Traps will never miss, because it bypasses elemental and other modifiers.

= Stats =

In this section, I'll be going over the stats, giving general information about them and their importance when playing a Trap Ranger.
The importance of each stat will be rated with low, mid or high. Because I'll be showcasing some builds later on, most of the stats will probably have two ratings because their importance varies depending on the trapping build you want to use.

*Low will indicate, that the stat will be somewhere between 1-40 after using stat points
*Mid will indicate, that the stat will be somewhere between 41-100 after using stat points
*High will indicate, that the stat will be somewhere between 101-130 after using stat points

! style=" width: 54% " | General Information
! style=" width: 38%"  | Notes
|-
|'''STR'''
|Mid
|style="text-align:left"|
*Increases ATK when using melee weapons
*Slightly increases ATK when using ranged weapons
*Increases Weight Limit
|style="text-align:left" |Because you'll be using a melee weapon most of the time as a Trapper, I suggest that you invest some points into this stat. How many? That's for you to decide. I usually tend to get 90 STR because of the ATK-Bonus that a '''{{Item List |id=2576 |item=Heroic Backpack |simple=yes}}''' provides when upgraded accordingly. 
|-
|'''AGI'''
|Low/High
|style="text-align:left" |
*Increases attack speed
*Increases flee
*Slightly increases physical defense
|style="text-align:left" |Since trapping relies on your survivability, you won't really need much points into AGI. If you want to go Trapper/Auto-Warg, you should invest as much AGI as possible though.
|-
|'''VIT'''
|Mid/High
|style="text-align:left" |
*Increases maximum HP
*Increases physical defense
*Increases natural HP-Recovery as well as the effectiveness of HP-Recovery items
*Increases resistance to the following status effects: Stun, Poison, Deadly Poison, Burning, Freezing
*Slightly increases magical defense
|style="text-align:left" |One of the more essential stats for a Trapper. You want to be as tanky as possible so I'd suggest to invest at least 90 VIT so you can get that '''{{Item List |id=2576 |item=Heroic Backpack |simple=yes}}''' bonus to make you even more tankier.
|-
|'''INT'''
|Mid/High
|style="text-align:left" |
*Increases mATK
*Increases maximum SP
*Increases Magical Defense
*Increases natural SP-Recovery as well as the effectiveness of SP-Recovery items
*Increases resistance to the following status effects: Blind, Sleep, Chaos
*Slightly decreases the variable cast time of skills
|style="text-align:left" |Trap Damage for both Hunter and Ranger Traps heavily relies on INT. I suggest you to invest as much points into INT as possible.
|-
|'''DEX'''
|Mid/High
|style="text-align:left" |
*Increases ATK when using ranged weapons
*Increases accuracy (Hit-Rate)
*Decreases variable cast time of skills
*Slightly increases ATK when using melee weapons
*Slightly increases mATK and magical defense
|style="text-align:left" |Ranger Traps heavily rely on DEX for damage as well, so investing as much points into DEX as possible would be best to maximize trap damage. Because your DEX will be pretty high and is generally a main stat for any Ranger Build, you'll also be able to use bows as a secondary option for damage if necessary.
|-
|'''LUK'''
|Low/Mid
|style="text-align:left" |
*Increases critical hit rate
*Increases resistance to the following status effects: Blind, Curse, Frozen, Poison, Silence, Sleep, Stone Curse, Stun
*Increases chance of using  {{Skill List |id=129 |skill=Blitz Beat |simple=yes}} or {{Skill List |id=2243 |skill=Warg Strike |simple=yes}} automatically when attacking
*Increases perfect dodge and critical hit defense (aka Crit Shield)
*Slightly increases ATK, mATK, Hit and Flee
|style="text-align:left" |I'm not really sure what to say about this one, since you'll probably only be getting points into this depending on the build you're going to run. For a tankier build that doesn't rely on auto-warging, you probably won't be investing any points into this stat.

= Skills =
In this section, I'll be giving you an overview of all the skills available to Rangers as well as an explanation on how or when you'll be using those skills (Yes, '''ALL''' of them~). Skills that are important for a Trapper or a specific Trapper-Build later on will be highlighted with a ☆.

The following format will be used to display general information about the Skill:

*This skill buffs yourself, increasing AGI and DEX by 12% at Level 10. This increase only effects DEX and AGI from stat points, job bonuses, passive skills and equipment bonuses. Card bonuses and other buffs do not count towards this increase. This skill, apart from removing it with {{Skill List |id=289 |skill=Dispell |simple=yes}}, can also be removed by {{Skill List |id=92 |skill=Quagmire |simple=yes}}.
*'''Usage: PvM/PvP since it's an essential self-buff at every stage of the game.'''

{|style="text-align:center" width="100%"

*Each point into this skill increases your DEX by 1. Because DEX is a main-stat for Rangers regardless of their build, you want to max this out no matter what.

{|style="text-align:center" width="100%"
|-
|style="text-align:left"    width="25%" | {{Skill List |id=44 |skill=Vulture's Eye |simple=yes}}

|style="background:#AAFFAA" width="10%"  | '''Passive'''
|
|-

*Each point into this skill increases the attack range for bows by 1. Other than that, there's not really much to say about this skill.

== Second Job Skills ==

{|style="text-align:center" width="100%"

|style="text-align:left"    width="25%" | {{Skill List |id=117 |skill=Ankle Snare ☆ |simple=yes}}

|-

*Sets a trap that will immobilize targets for a set duration when they step into it. The immobilize duration depends on the skill level and the target's AGI. Targets with higher AGI will be immobilized for a shorter duration. The minimum immobilize duration for this trap is 4 seconds. Boss monsters and MVPs can only be immobilized for the minimum duration, regardless of skill level. Targets immobilized by {{Skill List |id=117 |skill=Ankle Snare |simple=yes}} will receive additional damage from {{Skill List |id=2236 |skill=Aimed Bolt |simple=yes}}. 
*'''Usage: Good in WoE/PvP because it's great for disrupting enemies on their way through the castle. Because of its interaction with '''{{Skill List |id=2236 |skill=Aimed Bolt |simple=yes}}''', it's also useful in PvM as well as for MVPing or instancing.'''

*Increases your damage against Insect and Brute type monsters by a flat amount. Each level of this skill increases the damage slightly.

{|style="text-align:center" width="100%"

*Sets a trap that deals '''&lt;span style="color: green;">Wind Elemental Damage&lt;/span>''' in a 3x3 area when activated. Damage dealt is dependent on the level of this skill. This trap has a fixed cast time and is therefore not really practical for leveling purposes. I wouldn't say that it's impossible to level with this skill though since it still deals a good chunk of damage against '''&lt;span style="color: blue;">Water Elemental Enemies&lt;/span>'''.
*'''Usage: Good for one-shotting lower level &lt;span style="color: blue;">Water Elemental Enemies&lt;/span> but doesn't have much use apart from that.'''

|
|-
|}

*This skill commands your falcon to attack in a 3x3 area around the selected target. The level of this skill affects the number of hits your falcon will do. Falcon damage heavily relies on INT and to some extend also on DEX. The Level learned of {{Skill List |id=128 |skill=Steel Crow |simple=yes}} also determines how much damage your falcon will deal. This skill has a chance to auto-cast which increases depending on your LUK-Stat when using auto attacks. The level of auto-cast {{Skill List |id=129 |skill=Blitz Beat |simple=yes}} depends on your Job-Level and also on the level you actually have this skill learned on. As a Ranger you will get a way better version of this skill which will be using a warg.
*'''Usage: Because of the warg skills you can get as a Ranger, this skill is basically obsolete and doesn't have any use for PvM/PvP. While leveling your Hunter/Sniper, using '''{{Skill List |id=47 |skill=Arrow Shower|simple=yes}}''' or '''{{Skill List |id=382 |skill=Focused Arrow Strike |simple=yes}}''' are more efficient. If you want to have some fun with an auto-attack build early on though, I'd recommend you get this then.'''

*Sets a trap that deals '''&lt;span style="color: red;">Fire Elemental Damage&lt;/span>''' in a 5x5 area when activated. Damage dealt is dependent on the level of this skill. This trap has a fixed cast time and is therefore not really practical for leveling purposes. I wouldn't say that it's impossible to level with this skill though since it still deals a good chunk of damage against '''&lt;span style="color:#8F4C21;">Earth Elemental Enemies&lt;/span>'''. Apart from that, this trap is also able to destroy any traps as long as they're inside it's explosion area. If you plan on using this trap to level up, you should place them far enough apart as to not let have one destroy another.
*'''Usage: Good for one-shotting lower-mid level &lt;span style="color:#8F4C21;">Earth Elemental Enemies&lt;/span> but doesn't have much use apart from that.'''

*Sets a trap that when activated, will replay any message you typed into it before placing it. I like to call it '''"The Life Insurance Trap"'''. As I explained in the General Mechanics section of this guide already, traps can be damaged by different sources or skills but never directly. Because traps have this mechanic, as long as you place them somewhere where they can get hit by the AoE of {{Skill List |id=2253 |skill=Fire Traps |simple=yes}}, you can use them to heal yourself up when using '''{{Card |id=4115 Hunter Fly Cards}}''' and/or a '''{{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |simple=yes}}'''. Because {{Skill List |id=125 |skill=Talkie Box |simple=yes}} lasts 10 minutes and basically has infinite HP unlike other traps, it's the perfect candidate for the purpose of self healing. Oh, and you can also stack this trap on the same cell without having to worry to search for a free cell to place it on.
* '''Usage: Mostly for PvM/MvPing to be able to tank hard hitting mobs for longer periods of time.'''

*Places a trap that damages enemies in a 5x5 area and also inflicts the burning status. This trap can be placed directly under enemies. The burning status does not affect Boss or MVP-Monsters. This is basically the most important skill for a Trapper, since you'll be using this trap all the time. It does a pretty decent amount of damage and also applies the burning status effect to enemies hit with a 100% chance at level 5. Because traps placed with this skill vanish instantly when activated, trapping speed should be heavily reliant on your attack speed, which is only half the truth though. This trap has a slight cooldown (should be around 0.2 or 0.3 seconds) but because of the animation delay when placing a trap, you are only able to place one of these traps every 0.5 seconds (~160 attack speed needed) '''when you don't get hit by attacks'''. If you get hit by any attacks or multi-hit skills, the animation of you receiving damage will cancel out the animation you're in when placing/after having placed a trap, therefore allowing for you to trap as fast as your attack speed allows you too.

*Increases your attack power and resistance to Brute, Fish and Plant-Type monsters by a flat amount.

*This skill removes any traps and reveals hidden enemies around the user. There's also a chance that {{Skill List |id=2244 |skill=Warg Bite |simple=yes}} will be used automatically after activating this Skill. This is basically your only way to remove your own Ranger Traps to be able to pick them up again, since {{Skill List |id=124 |skill=Remove Trap |simple=yes}} only works on Hunter Traps. If you don't mind destroying your own traps, you can skip this and just use {{Skill List |id=2237 |skill=Detonator |simple=yes}} instead to remove your Ranger Traps.
*'''Usage:  This is basically more of a PvP/WoE skill because of how it works. If you get blocked by traps you can remove them fast and efficiently with this. Revealing enemies with a chance to immobilize them with '''{{Skill List |id=2244 |skill=Warg Bite |simple=yes}}''' (if it even auto casts after using it) is nice as well but you shouldn't put your expectation up too high for this to happen.'''

*Increases the ATK of damage-skills that you can use with your warg. Also enhances some of the extra effects of warg related skills.  You should consider getting this for the Auto-Warg/Trapper build even if it's only a slight damage increase.

*Increases the damage you deal with traps significantly. Also increases your INT and MaxSP with each Level. You need to get this when you're playing a Trapper.

*Increases ranged damage significantly at the cost of all your defense. This buff has a duration of 1 minute, a cooldown of 5 minutes and is basically a must-have for the Aimed Bolt/Trapper build and all other Ranger builds that use Bows as their main weapon.
*'''Usage: Can be used for both PvM and PvP to deal absurd amounts of damage for a short period of time.'''

*Sets a trap that changes the element of enemies hit to '''&lt;span style="color:green;">Wind&lt;/span>'''. This trap can be placed directly under enemies. The effect does not work against Boss or MVP-Monsters and also not against players.
*'''Usage: If anything, you can only use this trap for PvM and nothing else. I personally haven't played with this trap because I don't see any use for it, since Ranger Traps deal pseudo-elemental damage, but it might be good in a party setup if you need this specific element.'''

*Commands your warg to deal moderate damage to a single target with a chance of immobilizing it. The chance of immobilization depends on this skills level, the level learned of {{Skill List |id=2245 |skill=Tooth Of Warg |simple=yes}} as well as the targets AGI-Stat and can't go below 50% chance.
*'''Usage: I haven't tested this skill for PvM so far since tanking most stuff as a Trapper is always the better option, but this is definitely a great skill for WoE/PvP. If you immobilize someone with this and follow it up with  '''{{Skill List |id=2236 |skill=Aimed Bolt |simple=yes}}''', depending on your and their equip you might be able to one-shot your target.'''

*Commands your warg to run into one direction until you hit a wall or an enemy. If you hit an enemy, this skill will deal damage in a 3x3 area. Damage is dependent on ATK, weight and the learned level of {{Skill List |id=2245 |skill=Tooth Of Warg |simple=yes}}. Movement speed of this skill depends on how fast you were when activating it. If you get hit or rooted by anything, this skill will still be active and you need to cancel it yourself to do anything again.
*'''Usage: You can basically skip this. I personally haven't found any use for this skill so far but if there is, feel free to let me know.'''

*Enables the summoning/use of a warg. Usually a mandatory skill to get for a Ranger because a warg does everything better than a falcon.

*Enables you to ride your warg. This skill is pretty much a mandatory get, especially for a Trapper. Not only are you able to move around really fast when you combine this skill with {{Skill List |id=383 |skill=Wind Walk |simple=yes}}, you're also able to use most trapping skills while riding your warg. So apart from buffing yourself with {{Skill List |id=45 |skill=Improve Concentration |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=380 |skill=True Sight |simple=yes}} and  {{Skill List |id=383 |skill=Wind Walk |simple=yes}}, there'll never be really a need to dismount from your warg.
* '''Usage: Good for PvM and PvP, since being able to move around faster always has it's perks'''

|-
|style="text-align:left"    width="25%" | {{Skill List |id=2243 |skill=Warg Strike ☆ |simple=yes}}

*Commands you warg to deal moderate damage to a single target. This is the secondary damage skill you'll be using when running a Trapper/Warger build. Reuse-Speed of this skill is dependent on your attack speed , so the more attack speed you have the faster you can use this skill. Damage is slightly dependent on the current level of {{Skill List |id=2245 |skill=Tooth Of Warg |simple=yes}} learned. Since this skill functions the same way as {{Skill List |id=129 |skill=Blitz Beat |simple=yes}}, there's also a chance of casting this skill when using auto attacks. Drain effects from '''{{Card |id=4115 Hunter Fly Cards}}''' and '''{{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |simple=yes}}''' work as well when using this skill. While being a crucial part for the Trapper/Warger build, this skill is also your free "get out of jail" card. Since you'll be riding your Warg almost all the time as a Trapper, you can use this skill to basically get out of hit-lock from several mobs, or if you're rooted by something like {{Skill List |id=2479 |skill=Thorn Trap |simple=yes}} to "move around".
* '''Usage: Mostly during PvM to deal damage with it either by normal use or as an auto cast. Otherwise for PvM and PvP to move around in certain situations'''

*An advanced form of the skill {{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}} that deals moderate damage to Insect or Brute monsters. Can only be used after {{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}}.
*'''Usage: Because it's a skill that requires you to be under the effect of '''{{Skill List |id=460 |skill=Hunter Spirit |simple=yes}}''', it's a bit impractical unless you have a Soul Linker on a second account. You could use this instead of '''{{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}}''' for leveling during the Hunter/Sniper stages though.'''
