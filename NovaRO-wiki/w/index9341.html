=Ancient Juperos Repeatable Quests=
If you're doing the quests for the first time, you can pick all of them at once. The second time however, you will only be able to choose the quests from either the Rekenber or the Academy. The quests must be fully completed before they can be reset. There are no cooldowns on them, so you can repeat them as many times as you want. You simply cannot do both groups at the same time.

* Completing all Rekenber Repeatable Quests gives 30 {{Item List nro|id=34704|item=Rekenber Tickets}} (for a total of 55) and 1 {{Item List nro|id=34714|item=Research Papers}}.
* Completing all Academy Repeatable Quests gives 30 {{Item List nro|id=34705|item=Academy Tickets}} (for a total of 55) and 1 {{Item List nro|id=34714|item=Research Papers}}.

=== Enchants ===
All the Racing Caps can be enchanted once acquired and at the same NPC - Republic Quatermaster.

You can '''reset''' the enchants at any moment for 10 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}} and 500,000 zeny. '''The whole enchantment process has no risk of destroying your item.'''

On the final enchant, Republic Quatermaster will offer you an option to buy the Special Enchant corresponding to your headgear for a higher price.

It costs 950 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}} and 500,000 zeny to pick the matching enchant. You can use the regular price for a chance at a random enchant.

Once you have obtained a Special Enchant, it can be upgraded in a similar fashion to [[Bio5 Headgears]]. In this case the max level is 3 and it has the following costs:
* From level 1 to level 2: 25 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}} and 100,000 zeny. (20% success chance)
* From level 2 to level 3: 50 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}} and 300,000 zeny. (5% success chance)

Be aware that this upgrade has a chance to fail and downgrade to the previous level. But it won't go below level 1:
* Safe Enchant Upgrade cost from 2 to 3 (No downgrade upon failure): 250 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}} and 1,500,000 zeny

You can also re-roll the stats at any time. Each attempt costs:
* Slot #1: 30 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}}, 10 {{Item List nro|id=34704|item=Rekenber Ticket}}, and 300,000 zeny
* Slot #2: 60 {{Item List nro|id=34712|item=Juperium Energy}}, 10 {{Item List nro|id=34705|item=Academy Ticket}}, and 350,000 zeny
