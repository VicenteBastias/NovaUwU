The '''Rune Knight''' (RK) is the 3rd job class of Knights. Rune Knights are powerful physical damage dealers, capable of dealing heavy melee damage to a single target or destroying mobs of enemies using Dragon Breath. They also have access to special consumable items called runes, which perform a variety of unique buffs and effects.

= Builds =

== Dragon Breath ==

Dragon Breath builds are very common in party play PVM and organized [[War of Emperium]]. They focus on dealing heavy area damage using {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath|simple=yes}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004 |skill=Dragon Breath - Water|simple=yes}}. However, both Dragon Breath skills have a significant [[Intro1#Cast and Delay| Cast Delay]] of 2 seconds, which will normally prevent spamming while playing alone. Therefore, this build works best when stacking After Cast Delay reduction, with gears such as {{Item List|id=18813|item=New Wave Sunglasses}} and also {{Skill Info|class=Bard|id=321|skill=Poem of Bragi|simple=yes}}.

The most important aspect of the build is to have as much HP and SP as possible, and then to stack ranged damage bonuses. However, cast delay reduction will take higher priority over other stats.

Be aware that since the rework of runes that Dragon Breath can now have other elements besides Water and Fire.

=== Dragon Breath Build ===
:'''STR :''' 1-100
:'''AGI :''' 1-100
:'''VIT :''' 100-130
:'''INT :''' 100-120
:'''DEX :''' 100-130
:'''LUK :''' 1-100

Points depend a lot on what you want to do with it - WoE or PVM (AGI and LUK help a lot with resistances besides other factors) - but the main focus is in fast cast and lots of HP and SP (VIT/DEX/INT).

STR is mostly there just for the weight but can also be used in a semi-hybrid DB with some other heavy hitter skills.

== Critical ASPD ==

This build is mainly for ''Solo Play''. Utilizing their many self-buffs, especially with {{Item List2|id=22540|item=Lux Anima Rune}}, Rune Knights can be extremely powerful auto-attackers. Critical ASPD build RKs are one of the most potent as well as self-sustaining single-target damage dealers of the entire game. With Critical hits also ignoring monster's FLEE, this build is also suitable for hunting down hard-to-hit enemies.

The downside to this build is that if they go a pure Critical ASPD build, they won't have any particularly reliable AoE damage outside from when Storm Blast is auto-casted, which means they're only useful against a handful of endgame content. It's possible to mix it with other skills/builds available and make an hybrid char that focus on ASPD against single targets such as MVPs.

=== Critical ASPD Build ===
:'''STR :''' 100-130
:'''AGI :''' 1-120
:'''VIT :''' 100 TOTAL at least
:'''INT :''' 1-30
:'''DEX :''' 1-80
:'''LUK :''' 90-130

STR is you main source of damage.

AGI will depend A LOT on the gears of the player. It's possible to achieve 193 ASPD with 1 base AGI nowadays no matter what some players think although it's not advisable as it also helps a bit with flee and to resist some status.

DEX and INT are mostly stats for a secondary AoE skill as a mob cleaner and some okay-ish SP regen. If you don't care about that, you can ditch them.

LUK depends on the boots you use and your CRIT needs. There are a bunch of options that let you use less or more LUK. Check the [[Rune_Knight#Footgear|Footgear]] section if you want to have an idea.

== Spiral Pierce ==

Much less common than the two listed above, {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight |id=397 |skill=Spiral Pierce |simple=yes}} builds specialize on heavy single-target damage. This makes it suitable for killing off bosses of most endgame party [[Instances]]. The build itself relies on having a Minstrel to give {{Skill Info|class=Bard|id=321|skill=Poem of Bragi|simple=yes}} to reduce [[Intro1#Cast and Delay| Cast Delay]] and/or After Cast Delay reduction gears.

Don't forget that you also need a way to remove the fixed cast of the skill or it will feel slow. Footgear such as {{Item List2|id=22010|item=Temporal Boots Of Dexterity|slots=1|simple=yes}} or the newest {{Item List2|id=22196|item=Illusion Leg A-type |slots=1|simple=yes}} with {{Item List2|id=25694|item=Modification Module (Fixed Casting)|simple=yes}} should help you make this build a lot more stronger than it initially would look in terms of DPS.

But that's not all. While the Spiral Pierce skill is the core of this build, you're still able to utilize the RK's AoE skills on the side. Notably, you can hybrid this build with {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath|simple=yes}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004 |skill=Dragon Breath - Water|simple=yes}} or {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2006 |skill=Ignition Break|simple=yes}}, which makes you a powerful damage dealer both for AoE and single-target, albeit you may need to swap your gears in the heat of battle at times.

=== Spiral Pierce Build ===
:'''STR :''' 90-120
:'''AGI :''' 1-100
:'''VIT :''' 100 TOTAL at least
:'''INT :''' 1-120
:'''DEX :''' 60-120
:'''LUK :''' 1-120

Your stats should help you to achieve 193 ASPD easier to help you spam it faster but at the same time to prevent status and give you a bit more of that extra survival that you may need here and there.

The cast time of Spiral is currently very short so high DEX isn't exactly a must but investing into some will always help to make it shorter and give you some extra HIT to prevent misses. INT on the other hand may end help you with the SP Regen and also cast, besides letting you go hybrid with {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath|simple=yes}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004 |skill=Dragon Breath - Water|simple=yes}}, so you may want to have a bit of both.

If there are leftover points and you don't know where to place them, you can just add them to LUK for extra hit or to change the build from a pure Spiral Pierce build into a hybrid with CRIT with a few changes of gear since Spiral Pierce misses on AGI UP. Since we now have access to {{Item List2 |id=21052 |item=Vernan |slots=2 |simple=yes}}, you may want to kill two birds with a stone and also make use {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2002|skill=Sonic Wave}} since the same weapon can be used for both builds.

== Ignition Break ==

This is an '''expensive''' melee build that depends a lot on gear to give good damage such as high refine {{Item List2|id=18971|item=Old Rune Circlet|slots=1|simple=yes}} and {{Item List2|id=4689 |item=&lt;nowiki>[&lt;/nowiki>Bio 5&lt;nowiki>]&lt;/nowiki> Seyren Windsor|simple=yes}} cards since it focus around {{Skill List|id=2006|skill=Ignition Break|simple=yes}}.

The skill has a cooldown of 2 seconds if you don't use a {{Item List2 |id=21051 |item=Volar |slots=2 |simple=yes}} (it will reduce it by 1 second), and a +11 {{Item List2|id=450127|item=Automatic Armor A-type|slots=1}} with 2 {{Item List2|id=1000153|item=Automatic Module (Wave Break)}}(it will reduce it by 0.5 seconds), it will be an expensive build to build to achieve the best of it. Some more economic ways do exist such as with +9 {{Item List2 |id=15397 |item=Str Soutane |slots=1|simple=yes}} and +9 and above {{Item List2 |id=21054 |item=Claw Sword |slots=2 |simple=yes}} but the difference in terms of damage per second is also way way different.

Saying this, while after the rework this skill doesn't ask anymore for 200+ CRIT but instead '''uses your normal CRIT rate''' to do critical hits all the time, if one wants to use it at 100%, it still demands for a hefty investment on gear that increase its damage. This also means that can be mixed with a pure auto-attack build since both share almost the same gears outside of the weapon cards.

Be aware that while it's possible to make a pure shareable build between both, this also require a weapon with a high refine and to make use of {{Item List2 |id=300086 |item=Greater Special Alnoldi |simple=yes}}.

The skill also has no fixed cast, the variable portion isn't short compared to some other skills and demands some investment in DEX, INT, and/or -%VCT gear to make it look fast.

=== Ignition Break Build ===
:'''STR :''' 100-130
:'''AGI :''' 1-120
:'''VIT :''' 80-100
:'''INT :''' 1-100
:'''DEX :''' 1-120
:'''LUK :''' 1-125

Stats will depend a lot if you want to make it a main build focused only on this skills, like for farming, or just to add it to something else and make it a hybrid, like adding it to an already CRIT ASPD build and swap when needed.

The main focus is STR for dmg, DEX and INT for the cast times, LUK to get CRIT. VIT and AGI should be adjusted according needs but having at least 100 VIT/AGI helps against some status.

If you want some help to achieve the 100+ CRIT values, you may want to give a look '''[[Template:Ignition Break CRIT Gears|here]]''' and pick what you think that suits better your budget and build.

== Sonic Wave ==

Ranged skill that can do critical damage.

Since it has no cast time and uses our current CRIT to do crit hits, it's super useful in lots of situations where you prioritize safety over damage. 

Be aware that it has 1.75 seconds of cooldown if you don't use a {{Item List2 |id=21052 |item=Vernan |slots=2 |simple=yes}}. If you use one, the cooldown will be reduced to 0.25s. Just don't forget that even with cooldown there is still 0.5s of delay.

Damage can be boosted through gears such as [[Mora Equipment#Rune_Knight|Peuz Set]], {{Item List2|id=32372 |item=Black Ribbon&lt;nowiki>[&lt;/nowiki>EVT&lt;nowiki>]&lt;/nowiki>|slots=1|simple=yes}},and cards that boost critical and ranged damage.

=== Sonic Wave Build ===
:'''STR :''' 100-130
:'''AGI :''' 1-120
:'''VIT :''' 80-100
:'''INT :''' 1-30
:'''DEX :''' 1-120
:'''LUK :''' 1-125

Since it's a skill that is both critical and ranged, DEX should only be added if you're recycling gears or min-max the dmg and using something like a {{Item List2|id=4593 |item=Menblatt Card |simple=yes}} that depends on DEX to increase your final damage.

If you want to make it viable with your current CRIT DMG gears, you don't need DEX at all, it's pretty much a normal CRIT build where having a high value of ASPD reduces the animation, STR helps with DMG, LUK with CRIT, VIT to survive a bit more.

== Hundred Spears ==

Heavy hitter ranged skill with a full variable cast bar that can also be used for a build centred around it.

If you want to do a build around this skill, you can call it an end game build since it asks for a +13 {{Item List2|id=30140|item=Illusion Pole Axe|slots=1|simple=yes}} to reduce the cooldown of the skill to 1 second and let you +/- spam it. Outside of that, you can fit this skill into a rotation with other skills with a decent amount of cooldown too such as Sonic Wave and Ignition Break as long as you remember that gears that boost it may not boost others at 100%.

=== Hundred Spears Build ===
:'''STR :''' 100-120
:'''AGI :''' 1-120
:'''VIT :''' 100 TOTAL at least
:'''INT :''' 1-60
:'''DEX :''' 60-120
:'''LUK :''' 1-60

If you want to do a build with this skill as your main skill, you're somewhat forced to have a {{Item List2|id=4593 |item=Menblatt Card |simple=yes}} in your garment to maximize dmg. Due to that you want 120 DEX.

STR is you main stat to increase DMG, VIT to survive, LUK to help with HIT and some extra ATK, the rest is completely up to you.

== Wind Cutter ==

Great beginner/levelling build that also works well in the mid-game as a pack killer. It's also perfectly valid in the end game provided that you know how to adapt to different situations since it has some limitations like any other hit dependent build.

Since it's an AoE skill that has an animation based on delay to be spammed (-40% delay to cap it in perfect conditions), you need gears such as [[Mora Equipment#Rune_Knight|Peuz Set]] and {{Item List2|id=32372 |item=Black Ribbon&lt;nowiki>[&lt;/nowiki>EVT&lt;nowiki>]&lt;/nowiki>|slots=1|simple=yes}} to boost the damage in the early game and slowly invest into some other to reduce the delay later on to improve the damage per second.

Depending on the weapon used, you may obtain different types of damage (detailed info about the skill available on the Rune Knight Skills section) such as:
*&lt;img src="https://novaragnarok.com/data/kRO/inventory/1152.png"> 2h Sword: Melee Damage, 2 HIT, Ignores DEF at 100%
*&lt;img src="https://novaragnarok.com/data/kRO/inventory/1401.png"> 1h/2h Spear: Ranged Damage, 1 HIT
*&lt;img src="https://www.novaragnarok.com/data/kRO/inventory/1207.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.novaragnarok.com/data/kRO/inventory/1360.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.novaragnarok.com/data/kRO/inventory/1501.png"> Other Weapons: Melee Damage, 1 HIT

=== Wind Cutter Build ===
:'''STR :''' 100-120
:'''AGI :''' 1-120
:'''VIT :''' 50-100
:'''INT :''' 1-120
:'''DEX :''' 60-120
:'''LUK :''' 1-60

Add enough AGI to get 190 ASPD after adding DEX since the skill has 0.2 seconds of cooldown. Yes, you don't need 193 unless you want to go hybrid.

STR is the main stat for damage, DEX is just to get enough HIT to prevent misses and LUK to get a bit of it too in some more extreme places that ask you to push it to the limit.

If you're using this to farm, you may want to get higher values of INT to help with the SP cost.

== Crush Strike ==

A more solo-oriented PVP build meant for fighting in [[Battlegrounds]] and NovaRO's monthly 5v5 Tournament. A {{Item List|id=12726|item=Crush Strike}} enhanced normal attack combined with the guaranteed critical from {{Skill List |id=61|skill=Auto Counter}} along with other damage enhancements will one-shot nearly every build in the game, even those using full defensive gear. Due to the Rhydo Runestone's re-use delay, Crush Strike RKs will act as hit-and-runners, taking out the most troublesome tanking builds and then retreating while waiting for Crush Strike to become usable again. More vulnerable targets can also be killed with {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2004 |skill=Hundred Spear|simple=yes}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2006 |skill=Ignition Break|simple=yes}} when Crush Strike is unavailable.

|{{Item List2 |id=5208|item=Rideword hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|[[Nova Shop#Hats|Cash Shop]], [[Custom Headgear Quests#Headgears|Custom Headgear Quests]]


|
Great farming headgear and starting upper headgear.

The chance to get HP/SP stacks with other items with similar effects so pairing it with something like, for example, {{Item List2 |id=21009 |item=Thanatos Great Sword|slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List2 |id=4115  |item=Hunter Fly Card |simple=yes}} ends being really good.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=5899|item=Black Ribbon |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

|
Amazing option for {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2005|skill=Wind Cutter}} and also really good for {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2002|skill=Sonic Wave}} builds if you don't have problems with CRIT.

Be aware that this item is modified inside [[Monster Hunter]] and there are better options below.

Free version of {{Item List2 |id=5899|item=Black Ribbon |slots=1 |simple=yes}} that can be obtained with {{Item List2 |id=32417|item=Endeavor Tokens}}. Due to that it can't be traded nor sold to other players.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=32885|item=Dark Knight Mask |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|[[Endeavor Tokens#Available_Equipment|Endeavor Tokens]]

Great option for physical builds that face Dragon, Angel, Shadow, or Shadow monsters.

Since it also provides -%delay at +11, it's also a nice option if you also need it.

|
Decent option for melee physical builds due to the ATK and MELEE DAMAGE it offers.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=21047 |item=Beam Claymore-OS |slots=2 |simple=yes}} for extra CRIT and damage against large size monsters

|
Currently most of a [[Monster Hunter]] headgear for builds like {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2005|skill=Wind Cutter}} or {{Skill Info|class=Lord Knight|id=397|skill=Spiral Pierce}}.

Still has uses outside of it but it's mostly against very specific monsters and in very specific builds such as {{Skill Info|class=Lord Knight|id=397|skill=Spiral Pierce}}.

Cheap alternative for CRIT auto-attack builds (or to simply use it as a swap to use together with {{Item List2|id=12726|item=Rhydo Runestone}}) to the expensive option {{Item List2|id=18971|item=Old Rune Circlet |slots=1}}.

While it doesn't seem like it provides much, the {{Skill Info|class=Thief|id=48|skill=Double Attack Lv 5}} makes your damage per second reach similar values as if you had {{Item List2|id=18971|item=Old Rune Circlet |slots=1}} with {{Item List2|id=29084|item=Acute Lv. 4}}.

|-
|{{Item List2|id=18971|item=Old Rune Circlet |slots=1}}
|[[Tomb of the Fallen|Tomb of the Fallen (Bio 5)]]
|
The best for builds based on {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2006|skill=Ignition Break}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2004|skill=Hundred Spear}} and also equally great for auto-attack builds.

Do not invest into this unless you've a shit ton of Zeny to spend (something like 300M+) or lots of time to spend in the dungeon. Getting the correct special enchant that benefits your build is 100% RNG and it may take ages to some.

|
Offers less -%delay at +9 when compared to a {{Item List2 |id=18563|item=+9 Heart Wing Headband |slots=1 |simple=yes}}  but some enchants may provide a bit of extra damage useful in some builds.

{{Enchanted|
link=[[Illusion Dungeons#Illusion_Enchants|Illusion Enchants]]

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2|id=15348|item=Illusion Goibne's Armor|slots=1}} + {{Item List2|id=20923|item=Illusion Goibne's Spaulders|slots=1}} + {{Item List2|id=22192|item=Illusion Goibne's Greaves|slots=1}} for a bunch of nice bonus such as extra HP, less fixed cast, and -%delay. The entire set is nice if you're looking for a mix of -%delay and HP.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=19474|item=Temporal Circlet (Rune Knight)|slots=1 |simples=yes}}
|[[Glast Heim: Challenge Mode]]
|
The best for {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008|skill=Dragon Breath}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004|skill=Dragon Breath Water}} builds due to the skill bonus it offers and the enchants it can get.

It's also the best for {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2002|skill=Sonic Wave}} builds since it provides ranged damage, something usually rare to have unless you build specifically for that, and -%delay and, together with the enchants you can get, it fits perfectly in the build as the best possible available at the moment.

-5% aftercast delay contrary to the -10% that the non-slotted option offers but adds a slot in case the players wants to use something in this slot.

Good in some specific occasions with specific cards.

If your build don't have issues with delay, this is a decent option at +7 until the player can afford a better option.

Don't waste money on a +9, a +7 {{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor A-type |slots=1|simple=yes}} with 1 {{Item List2 |id=25687 |item=Modification Module (Power)|simple=yes}} is just a bit more expensive and has space for future improvement.

It's also a viable balanced option between damage and CRIT if you lack CRIT for some specific content since the better option, {{Item List2 |id=450127 |item=Automatic Armor A-type |slots=1|simple=yes}}, doesn't offer it unless you '''waste''' a slot with {{Item List2|id=1000131|item=Automatic Module (Critical Force)}} (not worth overall due to the small increase of CRIT and damage it provides).

Against content with Demon/Angel, it still provides better damage than the other options when the build benefits from it (this doesn't instantly translate to DPS since that depends on a lot of factors).

|If for some reason you need more CRIT and can't reach it somehow, or saw a cheap opportunity here compared to a bigger investment in other gear, this is the armor to get.

Be aware that the trade off here is that the dmg provided is way lower compared to a {{Item List2 |id=15397 |item=Str Soutane |slots=1|simple=yes}}.

While the first look may be that it looks like a small improvement when compared to an {{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor A-type |slots=1|simple=yes}}, the enchants change everything and make it currently the best armor available when '''properly enchanted for your build'''.

For example: if you've too much skill mods, adding skill specific enchants it's worse vs others that boost your dmg overall like {{Item List2|id=1000122|item=Automatic Module (Power)}}.

Be aware that vs Demon/Angel races, when the build benefits from racial/size mods, {{Item List2 |id=15397 |item=Str Soutane |slots=1|simple=yes}} still provides better damage (this doesn't instantly translate to DPS since that depends on a lot of factors).

Mostly an option for builds that depend on delay because of the combo with the {{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor A-type |slots=1 |simple=yes}} such as {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2005|skill=Wind Cutter}} or {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2002|skill=Sonic Wave}} after getting a {{Item List2 |id=21052 |item=Vernan |slots=2 |simple=yes}}.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor A-type |slots=1 |simple=yes}} to get a reduction in delay of skills
*{{Item List2 |id=22196 |item=Illusion Leg A-type |slots=1 |simple=yes}} to increase your ranged damage

The only reason to this be here is just because if you actually need a higher delay reduction and you don't have enough zenny for better options, and also expensive, such as {{Item List2 |id=19439 |item=Vicious Mind Aura |simple=yes}} + {{Item List2 |id=20749 |item=Fallen Warrior Manteau|simple=yes}} or [[Temporal Stat Manteaus]], this is a very nice alternative when refined to +9.

It may not provide that many bonus as the better options, but with {{Item List2 |id=27343 |item=Chaotic Acolyte |simple=yes}}, for example, it can be that tiny extra boost that you may need to kill something faster since you're not locked anymore into {{Item List2 |id=28311 |item=Sarah's Right Earring |simple=yes}} or {{Item List2 |id=28310 |item=Sarah's Left Earring |simple=yes}} with delay enchants that offer nothing besides a reduction to the delay of skills. You can use instead one that gives you more damage.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=15212 |item=YSF01 Plate |slots=1 |simple=yes}} to increase the value of -delay reduced
*{{Item List2 |id=15212 |item=YSF01 Plate |slots=1 |simple=yes}} + {{Item List2 |id=22141 |item=YSF01 Greaves |slots=1 |simple=yes}} to give you a small chance with physical attacks to bypass at 100% the hard defense of any enemy

Alone it's pretty much a better {{Item List2 |id=2576 |item=Heroic Backpack |slots=1 |simple=yes}} if the refine is above +10 but when paired with {{Item List2 |id=19439 |item=Vicious Mind Aura |simple=yes}} it offers a ton of good bonus useful for a bunch of builds.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=19439 |item=Vicious Mind Aura |simple=yes}} for a ton of sweet bonus such as - delay, + atk, +% ranged dmg, etc depending on the stats you've.

A great, although specific, option for physical damage. With the right enchants and refines, it can end a really good option for some end game content.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2|id=65142|item=Illusion Morrigane's Helm}} + {{Item List2|id=65144|item=Illusion Morrigane's Belt}} + {{Item List2|id=65145|item=Illusion Morrigane's Pendant}} for extra damage, PERFECT DODGE, CRIT, and even extra HP/SP

Garment that starts to excel at +8.

Higher refines help to deal with high values of DEF and MDEF from Brute and Demon monsters specially if you use the entire combo with the {{Item List2|id=22006|item=Temporal STR Boots|slots=1}}.

While great for most physical builds, some builds that depend on delay to spam may want to have the -delay enchant first before wanting to use it. The same may happen with some CRIT builds that need the CRIT from it.

Garment that starts to excel at +8. Higher refines help to deal with high values of DEF and MDEF from Brute and Demon monsters.

While it offers an inferior increase in terms of damage when compared to the options above for most builds, it also provides CRIT and ASPD that some players may lack on their builds.

It's usually the preferred option for auto-attack builds since CRIT DMG doesn't get the mod reduction (CRIT DMG mods are reduced by 50% for skills).

For the right slot, 2 perfect, or close to, equal enchants are great for some builds such as CRIT or the ones purely depending on ATK like {{Skill List|id=2005|skill=Wind Cutter|simple=yes}} to increase their final damage.

Outside of that spectrum, this is still a very nice option if you want to mix offense with defense due to some more defensive options, such as +3% ALL RES BUT NEUTRAL, being available as enchants.

Also remember that, because Illusion Boosters and Insignias are now also available (check both options below), {{Item List2 |id=2963 |item=Physical Enhancer Ring |slots=1 |simple=yes}} with different enchants is mostly a starting option for the right slot if you find something cheap. For the left slot you can just buy a {{Item List2 |id=52228 |item=King Schmidt's Strong Insignia| slots=1 |simple=yes}} (or the items needed to make them - More Info Available at [[Fall of Glast Heim]]) and ignore enchants for a while.

Insignias are expensive but currently the best to get for the left accessory slot with the right enchants.

There isn't currently a best to get nor the best enchant since it depends a lot on what you want to build and your current gear.

Just remember that if you're going for {{Item List2 |id=39588 |item=Strong |simple=yes}} as the 3rd enchant, the {{Item List2 |id=4875 |item=Bear's Might |simple=yes}} transformation makes some skills having a slower animation but doesn't matter much for auto-attack builds.

Not really a great option since RK can use {{Item List|id=12733|item=Hagalas Runestone}} for MDEF and loosing AGI in some cases hurts since it reduces ASPD and it's useful to reduce the animation of skills but it's a valid option if someone wants more HP and doesn't mind to pay the price.

|{{Item List2 |id=4337 |item=Porcellio |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1619 |name=Porcellio}}



|The easy to get option for players that want more ranged damage in this slot and started not long ago.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27103 |item=Restless Dead |simple=yes}}

|A better version of {{Item List2 |id=4337 |item=Porcellio |simple=yes}} in terms of utility since it prevents your weapon and armor to break
|-

Can be paired with:

|{{Item List2 |id=4115 |item=Hunter Fly |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1035|name=Hunter Fly}}


|Probably the card of election to use while farming with AoE skills since it can be used with gear of similar effect and keep your char always on full HP or close to because it gives you a chance that your attacks heal you based on the damage you give.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4094 |item=Archer Skeleton |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1016 |name=Archer Skeleton}}


| The card to use if you want to play with a Dragon Breath build. Also okay starting card for builds centered on ranged skills.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4521 |item=Sedora |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=2204 |name=Sedora}}


| Decent for some crit builds that don't want to spend much in the begin.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4464 |item=Aunoe |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1796 |name=Aunoe}}


| Better version of Sedora although also a lot more expensive.
|-
|{{Item List2|id=300094|item=Greater Ruba Papilla}}
|{{mob |id=20672|name=Greater Ruba Papilla}} from [[Water Garden]]


|Although alone it's just a better {{Item List2 |id=4464 |item=Aunoe |simple=yes}}, when you use it with the rest of the combo, it increases the damage of {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008|skill=Dragon Breath}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004|skill=Dragon Breath Water}} by a ton.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2|id=300089|item=Verporta}} + {{Item List2 |id=300101 |item=Broken Cleaner Card |simple=yes}} to get a big boost on {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008|skill=Dragon Breath}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004|skill=Dragon Breath Water}}
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4608 |item=White Knight |simple=yes}}
|[[Old Glast Heim]]


|Great overall option against medium and large size monsters.

If you're playing a build that makes use of a shield, such as a spear build, the combo gives a really nice boost in damage.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=4609 |item=Khalitzburg Knight |simple=yes}} to give some extra reduction and boost your dmg
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27361 |item=Contaminated Wanderer |simple=yes}}
|[[Abyss Glast Heim]]


|Best option against medium and large size monsters.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4140 |item=Abysmal Knight |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1219 |name=Abysmal Knight}}


|Due to how mods work, if you're using a weapon with more than a slot and most of the time you kill MVPs and/or mini-bosses, this is a great option since it may give you more dmg than a second equal card.

You've to do math to see if this is worth on your setup, don't blindly add it just because it appears here.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=300086 |item=Greater Special Alnoldi |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=20627|name=Greater Special Alnoldi}} from [[Hidden Flower Garden|Hidden Flower Garden - Second Security Area]]


|For the ones that use melee skills with two-handed swords, this is a great new addition.

Although it depends a bit on the refine of your weapon to be better than other options, it also makes powerful weapons like {{Item List2 |id=21054 |item=Claw Sword |slots=2 |simple=yes}} unbreakable and that enables you to use stuff like {{Item List|id=12726|item=Rhydo Runestone}} without being afraid that your weapon may break.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4253 |item=Alice |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1275 |name=Alice}}


|The best shield card to use against bosses if you're tanking but be careful against non-bosses since this card boosts the damage you get by a lot. This means that if you're against a MVP that has slaves that are tagged as non-bosses and hurt quite a bit, this may not be a good option.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27178 |item=Gaster |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=3740 |name=Gaster}}


|Pretty much the opposite of {{Item List2 |id=4253 |item=Alice |simple=yes}} but at the same time also weaker. You get less dmg against non-boss monsters and extra damage from boss monsters.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27176 |item=Brown Rat |simple=yes}}

|-

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27295 |item=Ancient Stone Shooter |simple=yes}}
|[[Illusion of Luanda]]
|Another option for Critical Damage and very similar to {{Item List2 |id=4594 |item=Petal |simple=yes}} but trades some of the Critical Damage at the cost of giving +%ASPD.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4593 |item=Menblatt |simple=yes}}

|A good card to get in this slot if you need Ranged Damage.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=300270 |item=Empathizer |simple=yes}}
|[[Thanatos Tower]]
|With the rework of Thanatos Tower, this card, whenever you can sacrifice the armor card slot for {{Item List2 |id=27295 |item=Dame of Sentinel |simple=yes}} and your char is already at level 200, is the card to go whenever you need Ranged Damage.

With 120 Base DEX the entire combo boost your Ranged Damage by 55% which is enough to even beat {{Item List2 |id=4593 |item=Menblatt |simple=yes}} in the garment slot plus a lot of good MVP cards in the armor slot.

Be aware that this card also removes 25% of your MAX SP.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=4392 |item=Dame of Sentinel |simple=yes}} if you're already level 200 for a huge boost in ranged damage.

With 120 Base STR the entire combo boost your Melee Damage by 55% which is enough to even beat {{Item List2 |id=4594 |item=Petal |simple=yes}} in the garment slot plus a lot of good MVP cards in the armor slot.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27260 |item=Odoric |simple=yes}}
|[[Geffen Magic Tournament]]



|Another "cheap" option for players that want more ranged damage in this slot.

It also gives you some +%ASPD.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27256 |item=Blut Hase |simple=yes}}
|[[Geffen Magic Tournament]]



|An expensive way to boost your ranged damage and +%ATK with a single card.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=31017 |item=Outrageous Cookie |simple=yes}}
|[[Horror Toy Factory]]



|Increases your +%ATK at the cost of your max HP and SP.

If you've a footgear with a high level of refine, this is a great option to increase your final damage.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=30144 |item=Deep Sea Merman |simple=yes}}
|[[Illusion of Underwater]]



|Increases your ATK based on how much you've of STR.

It's already a decent card on its own for physical builds but if you play a CRIT damage based build, using the combo makes it even better.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=30150 |item=Deep Sea King Dramoh|simple=yes}} to give crit damage.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27258 |item=Ifodes |simple=yes}}
|[[Geffen Magic Tournament]]



|Not as good as {{Item List2 |id=31017 |item=Outrageous Cookie |simple=yes}} at high refines in terms of how much +%ATK it boosts but trades that for extra +%ASPD and no HP or SP penalty.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27252 |item=Geffen Bully |simple=yes}}
|[[Geffen Magic Tournament]]



|Provides CRIT DAMAGE and ASPD in a single slot.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4925 |item=Essence of Evil LUK 3 |simple=yes}}
|[[Temple of the Demon God]]



|Cheap option to get CRIT at the sacrifice of a single slot.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27335 |item=Chaotic Baphomet Jr. |simple=yes}}
|[[Geffen Magic Tournament]]



|The card to go if you want extra CRIT in this slot and don't mind to sacrifice AGI for that because it's already part of your build.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4381 |item=Green Ferus |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1717 |name=Green Ferus}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4160 |item=Firelock Soldier |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1403 |name=Firelock Soldier}}



|Provides some STR and also HP and SP if you're using it on a +9 footgear.

Currently this card is outdated because you can achieve the same or similar effect in other cards, like {{Item List2|id=300089|item=Verporta}} or {{Item List2 |id=27118 |item=Ominous Freezer |simple=yes}}, without the need of the +9 footgear.

At the same time it should be cheaper when compared to those other options.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4107 |item=Verit |simple=yes}}
|{{mob |id=1032 |name=Verit}}



|Good card for HP and SP.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27118 |item=Ominous Freezer |simple=yes}}
|[[Illusion of Abyss]]



|Similar to {{Item List2 |id=4160 |item=Firelock Soldier |simple=yes}} but only provides HP. In exchange it gives a boost to {{Skill List|id=2004|skill=Hundred Spear|simple=yes}}. The boost is increased if this card is equipped on a +9 footgear.
|-
|{{Item List2|id=300089|item=Verporta Card}}
|{{mob |id=20665 |name=Verporta}} from [[Water Garden]]



|A {{Item List2 |id=4160 |item=Firelock Soldier |simple=yes}} card that doesn't need the refine to get the effect. It also gives a boost to {{Skill Info|class=Swordsman|id=7|skill=Magnum Break}} although the card is only important because of the combo with 2 others to boost the damage of {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008|skill=Dragon Breath}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004|skill=Dragon Breath Water}}.

Can be paired with:
*{{Item List2 |id=300101 |item=Broken Cleaner |simple=yes}} + {{Item List2|id=300094|item=Greater Ruba Papilla}} to get a big boost on {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=2008|skill=Dragon Breath}} and {{Skill Info|class=Rune Knight|id=5004|skill=Dragon Breath Water}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27340 |item=Chaotic Killer Mantis |simple=yes}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4919 |item=Essence of Evil VIT 3 |simple=yes}}
|[[Temple of the Demon God]]
|Cheap option to get VIT, and that means extra HP, and some MDEF at the sacrifice of AGI.

Not really a great option since RK can use {{Item List|id=12733|item=Hagalas Runestone}} for MDEF and loosing AGI in some cases hurts since it reduces ASPD and it's useful to reduce the animation of skills but it's a valid option if someone wants more HP and doesn't mind to pay the price.

|{{Item List2 |id=300101 |item=Broken Cleaner Card |simple=yes}}

'''NOTE:''' You can use two of them but the combo will work only once.
