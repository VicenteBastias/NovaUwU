= Overview =

The Guillotine Cross is the third job of Assassin and Assassin Cross. Though a lot of its skill kit is geared towards PvP, the Guillotine Cross (or GX for short) can also fit into multiple roles in PvM. Boasting high HP and defenses, high attack speed, and eye-popping DPS, GX's can operate as main DPS, DPS support, and even hard tanks with the proper stats and equipment. It's one of the widest-ranging classes to use in PvM, both in play style and difficulty. 

'''About Me:'''My IGN is Kayle Walker, and I've had GX as one of my oldest characters in Nova. Loved it when I started, and still loving it now. It can be easy, and it can be challenging even with experience. It's definitely a class worth playing and exploring.

With that said, this guide will cover different builds for Rolling Cutter, Crit, and Tank GX. From Katars, to dual daggers, to even weapons-and-shield, the GX is a fun and action-packed class for those who prefer an up-close and personal approach to combat!

= Stats =
*'''STR''' - Primary offensive stat. Increases ATK, weight limit, and DEF.
*'''AGI''' - Primary defensive stat. Increases Flee and ASPD.
*'''VIT''' - Kind of important (especially for Tank build), but not in all cases. Increases DEF, HP, HP regen, and grants immunity to stun (when Base and Bonus VIT adds to 100)
*'''INT''' - Junk stat, as it does not scale with any of the GX's main skills. Increases SP, SP regen, MATK, and MDEF
*'''DEX''' - Increases HIT, and a little bit of ASPD and ATK. Important for hitting things and building up your ASPD.
*'''LUK''' - All-around stat. A must-have for Crit Builds. Increases Critical Rate, Perfect Dodge, and a little bit of HIT and ATK.

= Skills =
These are the more important skills of each Job. Note that these are only what I think are must-haves by builds in PvM.
=== First Job Skills ===
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style="width:11%" |Skill
!Notes

|Up to 50% chance of dealing 2x damage (with increased HIT, up to +10) with Dagger Class weapons. It also adds damage to your left(off-hand) Katar damage (+21% at max). Is useful to have, but do '''NOT '''get this skill if you're aiming for Double Dagger Crit Build.
|-
|'''[[File:envenom.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Envenom Envenom]'''
|Active skill (ATK + 150 at max level)  that has a chance to Poison the enemy (up to 50%). Is required for the advanced Poison skills later on, so make sure to get this skill.

|-
|'''[[File:hiding.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Hiding Hiding]'''
|Makes the character invisible to players and monsters (except Insect, Demon, and Boss monsters). Useful, and needed to unlock Cloaking, so get it.
|-
|'''[[File:backsliding.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Back_Slide Back Slide]'''
|Moves you back 5 squares. '''VERY important. '''Can be used for things like moving fast, evading AoEs, and luring monsters. Practice using this skill. (More tips in Tank Build and Sin-Hacks)
|}

=== Second/Trans Job Skills ===
{| class="wikitable"
! style="width:14%" |'''Skill'''
!'''Notes'''
|-
|'''[[File:lefthand.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Lefthand_Mastery Left-Hand Mastery]&lt;br>[[File:righthand.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Righthand_Mastery Right-Hand Mastery]'''

|-
|'''[[File:katarmastery.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Katar_Mastery Katar Mastery]'''
|Increases ATK dealt by Katars, up to +30. Pretty much mandatory for any build, because it unlocks most of the GX's offensive skills.
|-
|'''[[File:sonicblow.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Sonic_Blow Sonic Blow]'''
|An active skill (800% ATK at level 10) that has a chance to stun enemies, up to 30%. A good single-target burst skill for pre-GX levels. Also required for the same reasons as above.

|A 5x5 player-based AoE attack that deals up to 440% ATK and has a 55% chance at max to leave enemies stunned, blind, or bleeding. A good AoE skill for pre-GX levels.

|First skill allows you to create {{Item List |id=678 |item=Poison Bottle |simple=yes}} (Ingredients in Sin-Hacks). The second skill (also called EDP) enchants your weapon with the item, and grants you a '''HUGE''' bonus to ATK ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/ATK#Weapon_ATK Weapon ATK] multiplied by 5, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/ATK#Equipment_ATK Equipment ATK] multiplied by 4 at max) and chance to inflict [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Deadly_Poison Deadly Poison] to non-Boss monsters. It's basically what makes GX viable as a DPS option from all levels of gear.

|Allows you to make (through Create New Poison) GX-exclusive poisons, most notably {{Item List |id=12718 |item=Leech End |simple=yes}} (for PvM; ingredients in Sin-Hacks). Additionally, it extends the duration of Enchant Deadly Poison, so this skill is a must-max.
|-
|'''[[File:poisoningweapon.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Poisonous_Weapon Poisoning Weapon]'''
|Enchants your weapon with a GX poison, and gives your attacks a chance (up to 20%) to inflict the effect on monsters. While useful, its used mostly as a set-up for the next 2 skills.

Removes the GX poison enchantment on use. A must-have skill for Tank builds looking to farm Biolabs and Gold Scarabas.
|}

= Builds =
I'll classify the builds as Cookie Cutter and Instance Rolling Cutter, Katar and Dual Dagger Crit GX, and Tank GX.

=== Cookie Cutter Rolling Cutter GX ===
Cookie Cutter is your "default" GX build, and is meant for farming and low-Flee Bosses.

==== Stats ====
*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 110
*'''VIT''' 80-100
*'''INT''' 1
*'''DEX''' 90-100
*'''LUK''' 70-90

The 120 STR unlocks the optimal ATK bonuses from {{Item List |id=22006 |item=Temporal STR Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{card |id=4588 Wakwak Card |simple=yes}}. High AGI and DEX gives you good ASPD and enough HIT for most monsters. VIT is there for stun immunity and tanking capabilities, but is otherwise optional because of the build's gameplay (explained below). LUK is also useful for this build, as it adds extra ATK and Perfect Dodge.

==== Notable Skills ====
[[File:rollingcutter.png]] '''Rolling Cutter''' is your bread and butter, with constant application of [[File:enchantpoison.png]] '''Enchant Poison''' to handle most elemental types (Don't use against Holy, Shadow, or Undead).

[[File:venomimpress.png]] '''Venom Impress'''  while under enchant if you want to make short work of monsters.

Use [[File:edp.png]] '''Enchant Deadly Poison''' and [[File:darkclaw.png]] '''Dark Claw''' for Bosses and High HP instance mobs (like Old Glast Heim)

Make use of [[File:hallucinationwalk.png]] '''Hallucination Walk''' when in a pinch, its Flee buff and MATK dodge can turn most battles in your favor.

==== Equipment ====
Headgear:
* {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is the standard RC GX upper headgear. It gives you HP/SP steal on physical attacks (Rolling Cutter), and makes this build sustainable.

** You can get this from Mora (10 [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Mora_Daily_Quests Mora Coins], after completing [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Hazy_Forest Hazy Forest]), or from Dullahans. Markets also sell these cheap.
* {{Item List |id=15097 |item=Hero Hidden Cloth |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is a more expensive alternative, but is also useful when its buff takes effect. 
** You can get this as one of the potential prizes in [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Bios_Island Bios Island] and [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Morse%27s_Cave Morse Cave].

* Armor Cards:
** Card with {{card |id=4337 Porcellio Card |simple=yes}} for a good ATK bonus or any elemental resist card.
Weapon:
* {{Item List |id=28000 |item=Thanatos Katar |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is hands down the best Katar for RC builds. Easy-to-get level 4 weapon with innate HP/SP drain, high base ATK, and good VIT bonus. Get this as soon as possible.

* {{Item List |id=2576 |item=Heroic Backpack |slots=1 |simple=yes}} rivals GSS with its bonuses, but I'd honestly only consider this an option when its upgraded to +9.
** Obtainable from the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Proof_of_Loyalty Loyalty Shop] in the Main Building, the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Gold_Coins Vending Machine] in Eden HQ, [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Battlegrounds Battlegrounds] and [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter Monster Hunter] (@go mh).

=== Instance Rolling Cutter GX ===
Instance RC build is a modified build meant for long, drawn-out instances like Devil's Tower, and bosses like Reaper Yanku and Celine Kimi.

'''NOTE:''' This is a "training wheels" build; with better equipment you can avoid this build altogether. This is meant for newer players who are interested in challenging the harder instances.

==== Stats ====
'''NOTE:''' Stats that are adjustable are marked with "~".
*'''STR''' 100~
*'''AGI''' 120
*'''VIT''' leftover
*'''INT''' 1
*'''DEX''' 100~
*'''LUK''' 100~
This build trades STR for higher AGI, DEX and LUK. A good mix of high Flee, Perfect Dodge, and HIT are needed to evade most of the bosses' attacks while connecting on most of yours.

==== Notable Skills ====
For the most part, this build shares the same skills and strategies with Cookie Cutter. Use of [[File:backsliding.png]] '''Back Sliding''' is encouraged for things like evading Reaper Yanku's AoE, or catching up to the Monoliths in Devil's Tower.

==== Equipment ====
This build shares the same equipment with the Cookie Cutter Build, with a few additions:

Headgear:
*{{Item List |id=5363 |item=Abysmal Knight Helm |slots=1 |simple=yes}} helps with mitigating Boss Monster (10% resist) damage.
*{{Item List |id=5490 |item=Anubis Helm |slots=0 |simple=yes}} works similarly to Abysmal Knight Helm, but can be better at higher refines due to the additional healing bonus.
** Both of these are obtainable via [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Cash_Shop Cash Shop].
Armor:
* {{card |id=4369 Venatu Card |simple=yes}} and {{card |id=4387 Ancient Mimic Card |simple=yes}} gives you additional LUK or AGI, useful for more Flee.
Accessories:
*{{Item List |id=2925 |item=AGI Glove |slots=1 |simple=yes}} for the slot, and additional Flee/Perfect Dodge
** Can be obtained the same way as {{Item List |id=2923 |item=STR Glove |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. (Needs [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ring_of_the_Wise_King Ring of Wise King Quest])
*{{Item List |id=2790 |item=Bradium Brooch |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is a weaker, but similar alternative.
** Obtainable via El Dicastes quests. (Needs [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ring_of_the_Wise_King Ring of Wise King Quest])
*Accessory Cards:
**Card with {{card |id=4027 Kukre Card |simple=yes}} or {{card |id=4051 Yoyo Card |simple=yes}}
Essence of Evil Lord (From [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Temple_of_the_Demon_God Temple of the Demon God] instance; Card for any slot):
* {{card |id=4910 Essence of Dark Lord STR 3 |simple=yes}} is a good source of ATK.
* {{card |id=4916 Essence of Evil Lord AGI 3 |simple=yes}} gives a good boost to Flee and ASPD.

=== Katar Crit GX ===
The easier of the 2 Crit builds to make, but is still '''not a build for new players'''. This build is built for high ASPD and single DPS, with fighting Boss monsters in mind.

==== Stats ====
'''NOTE:''' Stats that are adjustable are marked with "~".
*'''STR''' 90~
*'''AGI''' 120~
*'''VIT''' leftover
*'''INT''' 1
*'''DEX''' 90~
*'''LUK''' 120

120 LUK unlocks the optimal Crit damage bonuses from {{Item List |id=22011 |item=Temporal LUK Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{card |id=4594 Petal Card |simple=yes}}. 120 AGI unlocks the optimal ASPD bonus from {{card |id=4594 Cenere Card |simple=yes}}, if you choose to use that instead.  AGI and LUK are the two main stats for this build, increasing ASPD and Crit respectively. DEX is increased for additional ASPD, as Crit goes through any amount of Flee. STR is not as big an emphasis, as Crit damage rather than ATK is used as the main source of damage.

==== Notable Skills ====
As with Rolling Cutter builds, [[File:enchantpoison.png]] '''Enchant Poison''' should be used to handle most elemental types (Don't use against Holy, Shadow, or Undead). The main difference lies with auto-attacking as the main source of DPS.

[[File:venomimpress.png]] '''Venom Impress''', [[File:edp.png]] '''EDP''', [[File:darkclaw.png]] '''Dark Claw''', and [[File:hallucinationwalk.png]] '''Hallucination Walk''' is used similarly as with RC builds.

==== Equipment ====
Headgear:
* {{Item List |id=18934 |item=Fox Ears Ribbon |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is a great choice for Crit builds. It grants +10% ASPD, and a transformation buff that grants +100 Crit.

* {{Item List |id=18541 |item=Little Feather Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is another good headgear that gives 10% Crit damage bonus.
** Can be bought in the [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Proof_of_Loyalty Loyalty Shop] in the Main Building.
* {{Item List |id=5906 |item=Oni Horns |slots=1 |simple=yes}} at +9 gives your attacks a chance to cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Counter_Slash '''Counter Slash''']''' , '''which, aside from being a skill that scales off AGI, also '''crits'''. This is headgear is extremely powerful, and '''equally hard to come by'''.
* {{Item List |id=5388 |item=Snake Head Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} This Hat enables use of Level 5 Double Attack. '''Currently Double Attack is usable with Crit. '''

** Obtainable through [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Cash_Shop Cash Shop]. 
* {{Item List |id=5592 |item=Sigrun's Wings |slots=0 |simple=yes}} gives +1 ASPD. A very good mid headgear for Crit Builds.

* Headgear Cards
** Card with {{card |id=4468 Dark Pinguicula Card |simple=yes}} for +10 ATK and the ability to get Poison Herbs, {{card |id=4358 Gemini-S58 Card |simple=yes}} for status immunities, and {{card |id=4513 Angra Mantis Card |simple=yes}} for increased Crit Damage.
Armor:
* {{Item List |id=15038 |item=Sapha's Cloth |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is the standard Crit GX armor. It's also [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mora_Enchants enchantable] in Mora for further Crit bonuses.
** You can get this from Mora (10 [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Mora_Daily_Quests Mora Coins], after completing [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Hazy_Forest Hazy Forest]), or from Loli Ruris. Markets also sell these cheap.
* {{Item List |id=15097 |item=Hero Hidden Cloth |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is a more expensive alternative, but is also useful when its buff takes effect.
** You can get this as one of the potential prizes in [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Bios_Island Bios Island] and [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Morse%27s_Cave Morse Cave]. 
** At this point its a judgment call whether to pick a stable bonus (Sapha's Cloth) or a better bonus but via chance (Hero Hidden Cloth)
* Armor Cards
** Card with {{card |id=4387 Ancient Mimic Card |simple=yes}} for additional AGI or any elemental resist card.
Weapon:
* {{Item List |id=28010 |item=Juliette D Rachel |slots=2 |simple=yes}} The Best Katar for Crit Builds if upgrade is +8 or higher.
* {{Item List |id=28007 |item=Crimson Katar |slots=2 |simple=yes}} A great katar if high upgraded.
* {{Item List |id=1285 |item=Chakram |slots=2 |simple=yes}} is a great choice for Katar Crit when paired with {{Item List |id=2892 |item=Assassin Handcuffs |slots=1 |simple=yes}} as it has 2 slots, Malangdo-enchantable, and gains a 40% bonus to Crit damage with the combo. '''(currently unusable)'''
** Obtainable from Osiris and Champion Chen, both MVPs.
* {{Item List |id=1264 |item=Specialty Jur |slots=4 |simple=yes}} is another choice for Katar Crit. A level 1 weapon with 4 slots, it makes up for its low ATK with versatility and ease of overupgrading. It also allows you to be more flexible with accessories, as opposed to the Chakram combo. '''(currently unusable)'''
** Obtainable from Eremes, a Biolabs monster. Markets also sell these cheap.
* Weapon Cards
** Card with {{card |id=4464 Aunoe Card |simple=yes}}, {{card |id=4172 The Paper Card |simple=yes}}, {{card |id=4317 Mobster Card |simple=yes}}, or {{card |id=4521 Sedora Card |simple=yes}} for increased Crit damage.
* {{Item List |id=4608 |item=White Knight Card |simple=yes}} ATK +15 Increases physical damage inflicted on Medium and Large size monsters by 20%.
Garment:
* {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Faceworm Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}} for stat bonuses (Look for AGI, or AGI/LUK) and considerably increased max HP/SP when paired with {{Item List |id=22006 |item= any Temporal Stat Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}}.
** Obtainable from [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Faceworm%27s_Nest Faceworm Nest] instance. Is also usually sold in the market.
** '''NOTE:''' I strongly suggest getting GSS over Backpack if its below +9. Crit builds are focused mainly on upping AGI and LUK, and any additional stat helps. HBP, on the other hand rewards a spread-out stat build, which a Crit build is anything but.
* {{Item List |id=2576 |item=Heroic Backpack |slots=1 |simple=yes}} rivals GSS with its bonuses, but I'd honestly only consider this an option when its upgraded to +9.
** Obtainable through the Loyalty Shop in the Main Building, or Monster Hunter (@go mh)
**Card with {{card |id=4595 Cenere Card |simple=yes}} for an ASPD bonus, or {{card |id=4594 Petal Card |simple=yes}} for more Crit damage.
Footgear:
*{{Item List |id=22011 |item=Temporal LUK Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is the go-to shoes for any Crit build. Enchant with LUK (Critical lv3) or AGI (ASPD lv. 3) for initial enchant, and Hawkeye, Speed of Light or Lucky Day for the second enchant.
**All the materials can be obtained in [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim] instance (Normal and Hard modes). For enchanting, refer to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Temporal_Boots_Enchants#Temporal_Boots_.26_Enchants Temporal Boot Enchants]

Accessories:

Crit and RC builds share most accessory choices. Here are additional options:
*{{Item List |id=2928 |item=LUK Glove |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is a common accessory used for its slot and good Crit bonus.
**Can be obtained the same way as {{Item List |id=2923 |item=STR Glove |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ring_of_the_Wise_King Ring of the Wise King Quest])
*{{Item List |id=2892 |item=Assassin Handcuffs |slots=1 |simple=yes}} should be used if equipping a {{Item List |id=1285 |item=Chakram |slots=2 |simple=yes}}, but should be overlooked otherwise.
**Drops from Trentini, a Biolabs monster.
*{{Item List |id=2963 |item=Physical Enhancer Ring |slots=1 |simple=yes}} With Critical Damage enchant.
**Can be obtained in [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Geffen_Magic_Tournament Geffen Magic Tournament]

* {{card |id=27170 Shotgun Buffalo Bandit Card |simple=yes}} Give Agi + 7, Hit + 7 but only can used in left Accessory. When equipped with {{card |id=27171 Revolver Buffalo Bandit Card |simple=yes}} in right Accessory Str + 3, Atk + 3%. 
Essence of Evil Lord (From [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Temple_of_the_Demon_God Temple of the Demon God] instance; Card for any slot):
* {{card |id=4916 Essence of Evil Lord AGI 3 |simple=yes}} gives a good boost to Flee and ASPD.
* {{card |id=4925 Essence of Evil Lord LUK 3 |simple=yes}} gives a good boost to Crit.

=== Dual Dagger Crit GX ===
'''NOTE: '''This build is '''definitely not for new players'''. I highly recommend making a farming char first, or farming as an RC GX before attempting this.

Another Crit build, this time making use of the Assassin's ability to wield two weapons to deal considerably higher damage than Katar Crit.

==== Stats ====
'''NOTE:''' Stats that are adjustable are marked with "~".
*'''STR''' 90~
*'''AGI''' 120
*'''VIT''' leftover
*'''INT''' 1
*'''DEX''' 90~
*'''LUK''' 120
This build is identical to Katar Crit in stats, but needs a '''LOT''' more focus in '''AGI and ASPD stacking''' (with equipment, buffs, potions, and food) to retain a similar ASPD (this is from wielding 2 separate weapons, each with their ASPD penalty).

==== Notable Skills ====
Identical to Katar Crit build for offensive skills. Dual Dagger GXs should also max '''[[File:lefthand.png]]''' '''Left''' and '''[[File:righthand.png]]''' '''Right Hand Mastery''' to reduce the damage penalty from wielding two weapons.

'''NOTE: '''As mentioned above, '''do not add points into [[File:2attack.png]]''' '''Double Attack, '''it will interfere with your crits. If your High Thief adds even one point in that skill, '''this build will be ruined. '''Change to Assassin Cross at '''Job level 40''' to be safe.

==== Equipment ====
DD Crit and Katar Crit builds share many equipment choices. The difference between the two is their weapon of choice; a DD Crit wields two daggers (hence the name).

'''NOTE: '''Remember the '''Daggers Rule.''' Main hand should be for a '''high ATK''' dagger. Off-hand should be for''' '''daggers '''with effects or multiple slots for cards.'''

Main-hand Weapon:
* {{Item List |id=13090 |item=Faceworm Queen Leg |slots=2 |simple=yes}} is the best dagger in terms of Base Attack. It has 2 slots, and a transformation effect that allows you to cast Earthquake (a good AoE skill that scales with STR).
** Obtainable through Faceworm Nest instance. Commonly sold in the market.
* {{Item List |id=13047 |item=Weihna |slots=2 |simple=yes}} has lower ATK than FQL, but makes up for it by being Malangdo-enchantable. Add Crit enchants, and/or ASPD +1.
** Obtainable from Phreeoni, an MVP. Easy enough to beat, but is a sought-after boss; it may be better to buy it.
* {{Item List |id=13046 |item=Krieg |slots=3 |simple=yes}} is similar to Weihna, with 3 slots and 1 Malangdo-enchantable slot. Just weigh your options between the two.
** Obtainable from Eddga, an MVP.
Off-hand Weapon:
* {{Item List |id=13017 |item=Ice Pick |slots=1 |simple=yes}} might arguably be the best choice for an off-hand. Its effect ensures that your DPS doesnt go stale in the face of high DEF monsters.
** Obtainable from RSX-0806, an MVP 
* {{Item List |id=1230 |item=Ice Pick |slots=0 |simple=yes}} makes up for the lack of a slot by being Malangdo-enchantable. As with the weapons above, enchant it with crit and/or ASPD +1.
** Obtainable from Lord of the Dead, RSX-0806, and Assassin Cross Eremes, all MVPS.
* {{Item List |id=13035 |item=Sandstorm |slots=4 |simple=yes}} gives you a flexible way of boosting either Crit, Crit damage, or ASPD with its 4 slots. Its base attack isn't too bad for an off-hand, and can easily be over-upgraded above 10.
** Obtainable from Skeleton Generals (you can find them in Sealed Shrine).
* Any 4-slot, low level dagger, for over-upgrading reasons.
Weapon Cards:
* {{card |id=4464 Aunoe Card |simple=yes}}, {{card |id=4172 The Paper Card |simple=yes}}, {{card |id=4317 Mobster Card |simple=yes}}, or {{card |id=4521 Sedora Card |simple=yes}} for Crit damage.
* {{card |id=4575 Soheon Card |simple=yes}} for ASPD. ('''NOTE:''' Might be better to opt for Malangdo-enchants if your weapon is below +14. This is why 4-slot, low level daggers are useful)
* {{card |id=4463 Tendrillion Card |simple=yes}} for a huge ATK boost '''and '''Crit +15 on a +14 weapon. (Again, same rules with Soheon Card.)
Essence of Evil Lord (Card for any slot):
* {{card |id=4916 Essence of Evil Lord AGI 3 |simple=yes}} gives a good boost to Flee and ASPD.
* {{card |id=4925 Essence of Evil Lord LUK 3 |simple=yes}} gives a good boost to Crit.

=== Tank GX (Dagger and Shield) ===
A far cry from the fast-and-furious builds mentioned above, the Tank GX uses {{Item List |id=1232 |item=Assassin Dagger |slots=0 |simple=yes}} and a carded shield to drastically improve its HP and defense. This build is very situational; it's used primarily as a tank in Monster Hunter, and while having no offense, it can be used to farm the more difficult areas like Biolabs and Golden Scaraba Hole. 

==== Stats ====
'''Note:''' Adjustable stats are marked with "~" 
* '''STR '''1 
* '''AGI '''120 
* '''VIT '''100~ 
* '''INT '''90~ 
* '''DEX '''1 OR 90~ 
* '''LUK '''100~  

The point of this build is a mix of high Flee and DEF (and MDEF, depending on the situation). AGI and LUK should be above 100 for optimal Flee/Perfect Dodge. VIT is also a high priority here, to make full use of the HP bonuses from {{Item List |id=1232 |item=Assassin Dagger |slots=0 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Faceworm Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}} + {{Item List |id=22006 |item= Temporal Stat Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. INT is adjustable, depending on MDEF needs. DEX should be high when farming in Biolabs or Golden Scaraba Hole (explained below), but is not needed to tank in MH.

==== Notable Skills ====
In Monster Hunter, this build relies '''heavily '''on [[File:backsliding.png]] '''Back Sliding''' in straight lines to quickly lure monsters, so as I've mentioned, make sure to practice using that skill. '''Slide, spin the opposite direction, and slide again.''' This technique will take a bit of practice to master. You can also use '''[[File:cloakingexceed.png]]''' '''Cloaking Exceed''' to move faster, but every second is precious in this instance, so the faster, the better. When in position, activate '''[[File:weaponblocking.png]]''' '''Weapon Blocking''' for that 20% block rate, then tank away.

Outside of it, the build relies on '''[[File:cloakingexceed.png]]''' '''Cloaking Exceed''' and '''Teleport''' (from {{card |id=4040 Creamy Card |simple=yes}}) to get around the map. '''You do NOT engage in prolonged fights with this build. '''Your offense comes from hitting stuff '''once '''with '''[[File:venompressure.png]]''' '''Venom Pressure''' (while enchanted with {{Item List |id=12718 |item=Leech End |simple=yes}}), after which you should either get back into stealth or teleport away. Leech End inflicts a nasty DoT that persists until the targets die. (Does not work on MVPs)

Prepare poison '''[[File:poisoningweapon.png]]''' with '''Poisoning Weapon''', hide, '''[[File:venompressure.png]]''' '''Venom Pressure''' a target, then hide again. Rinse and repeat. It takes quite a bit of practice, and its in no way a quick kill, so prepare for a long game.

==== Equipment ====
Headgear:
* It shares the same headgear choices as Instance Rolling Cutter build (at least for Monster Hunter)

* {{Item List |id=5172 |item= Beret |slots=0 |simple=yes}} is a great choice against Duneyrr (Monster Hunter) and most Biolabs monsters.
** Obtained from Vanberks and Echios in Rachel Sanctuary. Easy to get, cheap in the market.
Armor:
* Can use any of the other builds' armors. GXs dont really have much in the way of high DEF armors.
* {{Item List |id=2394 |item= Glorious Suit |slots=0 |simple=yes}} is low DEF suit that grants you 20% max hp. Very useful for HP stacking.
** Can be obtained through Battlegrounds.
* Armor Cards
** Card with {{card |id=4031 Pecopeco Card |simple=yes}} for increased Max HP, or elemental resist cards.
Weapon:
* {{Item List |id=1232 |item=Assassin Dagger |slots=0 |simple=yes}} gives you +20% max HP, no strings attached. That's 5% higher than the GSS/ Temporal Stat Boots combo, and 10% higher than Pecopeco Card. This is a must-have for this build.
** Obtainable from Osiris and Assassin Cross Eremes, both MVPs. I suggest buying this off the market, as it is sold cheap.
* For people who somehow dislike that idea, you can opt for any 4-slotted dagger with {{card |id=4106 Mummy Cards |simple=yes}}, to help with hitting mobs with '''[[File:venompressure.png]]''' Venom Pressure.
Shield:
* {{Item List |id=2115 |item=Valkyrja's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is the best choice for a shield, having decent DEF with amazing elemental coverage.
** Obtainable from Valkyries. Best if you just bought this one.

* Card with {{card |id=4253 Alice Card |simple=yes}} for Monster Hunter (targets there are Boss monsters), {{card |id=4058 Thara Frog Card |simple=yes}} for Biolabs (Most of them are Demi-human), and {{card |id=4074 Bigfoot Card |simple=yes}} for Golden Scarabas.
Garment:
* {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Faceworm Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}} hands down. You need that HP boost. Look for VIT stats (Actually, even your normal GSS is good, what you want here is the HP bonus).
** Obtainable from Faceworm Nest instance. Is also usually sold in the market.
** Card with {{card |id=4133 Raydric Card |simple=yes}} for that nice Neutral resist.
Shoes:
* {{Item List |id=22011 |item=any Temporal Stat Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, as again, you're only after the HP bonus. Just use your normal ones.
** All the materials can be obtained in Old Glast Heim instance (Normal and Hard modes). The NPCs for making and upgrading the boots are to the right of Hugin (guy who teleports you into the instance).
** Uses the same cards as other builds.
Accessories:
* This build is flexible when it comes to accessories, as there aren't a lot of tank-specific accessories.
* {{Item List |id=2898 |item=Black Rosary |slots=1 |simple=yes}} is a solid choice for MDEF (+15) needs.
** Obtainable from Wraiths in Nightmare Glast Heim (left of Hugin, the Old Glast heim NPC)
** Card with {{card |id=4022 Spore Card |simple=yes}} for VIT, {{card |id=4064 Zerom Card |simple=yes}} for DEX
Essence of Evil Lord (Card for any slot):
* {{card |id=4916 Essence of Evil Lord AGI 3 |simple=yes}} gives a good boost to Flee.

= Sin-Hacks (Tips and Tricks) =

==== On Building A Would-Be GX ====
* You can actually experience all of the builds with a single character. You just have to make sure that you change jobs into Assassin Cross at '''Job Level 40. '''Switch points from [[File:Steal.png]] '''Steal''' into [[File:2attack.png]] '''Double Attack''' if you want a Katar-centric build, and vice-versa.
* By doing this, you actually level slower because you'll be skipping some of the leveling tricks I'll explain below. But it '''is '''worth it.

==== On GX's Early Game: ====
* Try not to skip on the Eden equipment. These are extremely useful for the early stages of your GX adventure.
* Nab's Set ({{Item List |id=15039 |item=Nab's Cloth |slots=1 |simple=yes}},{{Item List |id=2578 |item=Nab Hood |slots=0 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=2478 |item=Nab Shoes |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=2887 |item=Nab Ring |slots=0 |simple=yes}}) is a good set while waiting for your core items. Get this in the early stages.
** That means tackling Hazy Forest as soon as you're able. If you have money to spare at low levels, try to buy this piece per piece.
* Get a {{card |id=4040 Creamy Card |simple=yes}} as soon as possible. Farm it if you can. The utility of this card is endless.

==== Farming spots for GX's ====
* Beach Dungeon 2 (Stalactic Golems), Lv. 100-110
* Toy Factory F2 is also good Lv. 100-110, especially for getting {{card |id=4206 Myst Case Card |simple=yes}}.
* Also, Gonryun Dungeon 1F, Lv. 100-110
* Magma Dungeon 2, Lv. 110-120
* You can also do Rachel Sanctuary for Lv. 110-120
* Juperos or Geffenia, Lv. 120+
==== ATK Isn't Everything ====
* Things like Elemental Resist cards can sometimes save your life more than any amount of ATK.
** {{card |id=4141 Evil Druid Card |simple=yes}}, for example, changes your defensive element to Undead. This makes you immune to Stone Curse, which is what'll keep you alive in Devil's Tower, and against Celine Kimi at low health.
*** Standing still without defense while high-leveled monsters are hitting you is not a fun experience. 
*** ('''NOTE:''' Healing, resurrection, and some buffs '''cannot work''' on you while using this card.)
** {{card |id=4119 Bathory Card |simple=yes}} changes your defensive element to Shadow. If you've been to Old Glast Heim Hard Mode, you maybe familiar with Amdarais and its spamming of Dark Grand Crosses. This card nullifies the damage from that '''completely'''. 
*** The Dark Tendrillion in Monster Hunter also uses this ability. 
*** ('''NOTE: '''The Light Tendrillion does the normal version of Grand Cross, so make sure to remove this after taking care of the dark one.)
* Like I've mentioned in Instance Rolling Cutter build, prioritizing Flee is sometimes better than ATK.
** Hell's Judgement, a skill that a lot of instance bosses use, can be avoided by high Flee. This skill hits really hard, and can potentially one-hit-KO a non-tank character.

==== On Back Sliding ====
* The usual trick is stopping while moving to click at the '''opposite''' of the direction you want to head, wait for your character to take a step, then [[File:backsliding.png]] '''Back Slide'''.
* Another is using the /bingbing or /bangbang command to spin in place and then Back Sliding. Save it in alt+M to spam. Much faster, and you don't even have to move from your spot.
** 4 /bingbings or /bangbangs is a 180 degree turn, for reference.

==== On GX Soloing ====
* Geared GX's can indeed solo DPS instances. [[File:edp.png]] '''Enchant Deadly Poison''' ups your DPS to extreme levels, which means higher HP leech per hit. Its not uncommon to see a GX at red health go back to green in a matter of seconds while under EDP.
* You'll want to dual client while doing so, with an Arch Bishop (for buffs), or a Maestro for the Poem of Bragi skill.
* In doing this, GX's can farm instances like Horror Toy Factory and Old Glast Heim without needing to share loots as much. '''More loot = more money'''.
* But soloing also means carrying several characters' worth of DPS, so make sure you're prepared accordingly. Stock up on healing items, stat foods (if needed) and {{Item List |id=678 |item=Poison Bottle |simple=yes}}/{{Item List |id=12718 |item=Leech End |simple=yes}}.
* But that may be some ways yet to someone starting their GX adventure. You'll need help on the long path to GXdom, and so...

==== Learn To Make Friends ====
* NovaRO is still a multiplayer game, and a large part of it is dealing with other people.
* Join a guild, find a party, or even just sit around in towns and talk to people; it doesn't hurt to take a few minutes off whacking at monsters.
* At the end of the day, it's still more fun to go at it with a group of friends at your back.

= Leveling =
*'''Lv1 - Lv30'''
**Payon Dungeon F1 (get the Eden quest at Lv. 26)
*'''Lv31 - Lv71'''
**Orc Dungeon F1
*'''Lv72-Lv84'''
**Glast Heim St. Abbey (get Eden Boards for Evil Druid and Wraith, and also the Eden Training Quest)
*'''Lv85-Lv99'''
**Try to get a {{card |id=4040 Creamy Card |simple=yes}} around these levels.
**Eden Boards: Turtle Dungeon for 86-90, Turtle Dungeon, Veins/Rachel, Glast Heim for 91-99 (at least 5-6 quests from these)
***'''Do NOT turn these in yet.'''
**Do Finding a Fairy (first part) and Cautious Village.
***'''Do NOT talk to any NPC that'll give you EXP (Same as Eden).'''
*'''Transcend'''-'''Lv1-First Job'''
**(if going for Job Level 40) Level up manually. You should have equips or even a little bit of money at this point to buy NPC weapons.
*'''First Job-Job Level 40'''
**Level up using Eden Board Quests. Again, take note of your Job Level.
**You can also farm for a {{card |id=4040 Creamy Card |simple=yes}} around these levels.
**When you class change into Assassin Cross, follow the First Job-Lv87 step.
*'''First Job'''-'''Lv87 min.'''
**(If rushing), turn in everything you did in Lv85-Lv99.
*'''Lv87-Lv114'''
**Gramps and Eden Boards. Refer to the farming spots in Sin-Hacks for places to earn zenny.
*'''Lv115-Lv144'''
**Gramps and Eden Boards. Refer to the farming spots in Sin-Hacks for places to earn zenny.
**If you have time, try to farm for ingredients for {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}.
**You'll be strong enough to challenge Hazy forest at around level 120. Get a party and unlock Mora quests for Nab's/Sapha's set/Cloth.
**At level 120, '''Ghost Palace''' is unlocked. Try to stock up on potions to tackle this instance as soon as possible, and get {{Item List |id=28000 |item=Thanatos Katar |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. This is the core-est of core items for a starting GX.
**If you've gotten a {{Item List |id=28000 |item=Thanatos Katar |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, you can try to test your worth against lower-tier MVPs at later levels. (remember to bring {{Item List |id=678 |item=Poison Bottle |simple=yes}})
*'''Lv145-Lv175'''
**Gramps, Eden Boards, and solo instances like Ghost Palace, Sarah's Memories and Airship Assault.
**At higher levels you can try the Verus quests (especially useful for that Central Laboratory instance)
*'''Max Level'''
**The world is in your hands. Go and spin/stab/poison through it!

== Final Notes ==
First, I would like to thank all the people who've helped me compile this guide. This build wouldn't be possible without their advice.

To the people reading this guide, I hope you found this helpful for your GX journey!
