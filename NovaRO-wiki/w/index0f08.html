= Guide Overview =
Hi, I'm ggboyz and I'm writing this guide to share my knowledge of Renewal, especially skill mechanics/functionalities which I have accumulated over the years. This guide will talk about the notable/underappreciated skills of each class and aims to bridge the gap between newer and older players of Renewal to improve the competition and knowledge of the average player on NovaRO.

&lt;b>Disclaimer:&lt;/b> The guide may be relatively wordy, but it is also important to understand the reasons and thought processes behind making certain choices.

&lt;b>Message to Readers:&lt;/b> Currently holding off Rebellions and Dorams since there could likely be more fixes/updates in the future on these classes.


= Terminologies =
AoE - Area of Effect&lt;br>
BG - Battlegrounds&lt;br>
WoE - War of Emperium (think of Guild vs Guild to compete for a certain objective)&lt;br>
PvM - refers to monsters and bosses in fields, dungeons and instances&lt;br>
PvP - refers to places like PvP arena, BG, WoE&lt;br>
DoT - Damage over Time&lt;br>
ecall - Emergency Call skill which is usable by Guild Leaders only in BG Conquest and WoE&lt;br>
CC - crowd control in most cases, otherwise commonly used to refer to Sura [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2334/cursed-circle Cursed Circle] or Genetic Cart Cannon&lt;br>
DPS - Damage per second&lt;br>
ASPD - Attack Speed&lt;br>


= General Knowledge =
#For more general Renewal knowledge, visit [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Introduction_to_Renewal Introduction to Renewal] wiki page.&lt;br>&lt;br>
#You can use 2 of the same accessories (e.g. 2 Hiding Clips) and use Hiding then swap Accessory and Hide again with no animation delay. Swapping accessory will remove the skill, so if you have 1 Sight and 1 Hide, using Sight then swapping accessory will remove the Sight effect even if visually it still shows.&lt;br>&lt;br>
#Always use Box of Sunlight in WoE/BG so people don't get past you without notice.&lt;br>&lt;br>
#Put /sit on your macro (Alt + M), and you can change the macro key in Shortcuts. Good to deal with skills that force /sit you, like Windmill and Moonslasher.&lt;br>&lt;br>
#Put @refresh on your macro (Alt + M) to deal with situations where you are poslagged.&lt;br>&lt;br>
#Unlike Pre-Renewal, Emperium is not affected by skills that heal and safety wall.&lt;br>&lt;br>
#Often times newer players think "bugged skill" especially when it comes to AoE skills. AoE in RO is calculated starting from the center of the AoE. If a skill's AoE is 9x9, it means that the reach of the skill is (9-1)/2 = 4 linear cells away from the point of cast, then forming a square. [[File:Mini_AoE_Guide.png]]

Arch Bishop is a class that excels in supporting its party members. They can also sub as tanks and occasionally play as a damage dealer although not optimal.

Praefatio can be re-casted after 13 ~ 40 seconds. The barrier's defense is increased with more members in the party. Praefatio can not be stacked with Assumptio. The highest level Praefatio will overwrite the duration of lower level Praefatio, and lower level Praefatio cannot refresh the duration of higher level Praefatio. Praefatio and Kyrie Eleison interact in this way as well. Using Praefatio and Kyrie Eleison at the same level will refresh the barrier's duration. Pre-requisite for Oratio. Getting this at level 5 is preferred because level 10's cooldown is very very long. Your average damage character will reach the 30% HP barrier limit before 16 max hits.

&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Most notable will be the use of Lv 3 in places like BG as the 100% armor break is very frustrating for players on the receiving end when used in conjunction with status effect cards like {{Item List |id=4055 |item=Marina Card |simple=yes }}.

&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Often used to disrupt player actions, since some players respond very slowly to the force /sit.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> If you happen to force /sit a player and inflict a Status Effect such as Frozen, they are unable to stand until the effect is broken.

| Increases your ranged damage by a multiplier (x3.5 at level 5) for 60s at the cost of lowering all your DEF/MDEF to 1. Cooldown of 300s. Does not increase the damage of Warg skills or Traps.
| &lt;b>PvM/PvP:&lt;/b> Max this. The only builds that may opt not to add this is Dagger Warg build and Trap builds which do not use Bow skills. This skill is what makes Ranger good especially in the early stages of the game.
|-
||[[File:Electric_Shock.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2238/electric-shock Electric Shock]
| Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=7940 |item=Special Alloy Trap |simple=yes }}. Places a trap that will snare its target in 5x5 AoE and drain % MSP (25% at lvl 5) for a duration. Max of 3 traps can be placed. 
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Not very useful since mobs do not have SP. Use Ankle Snare for immobilising them.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be very frustrating for anyone who gets snared together with the high amount of SP drained over time. Max especially for BG/WoE.
|-
||[[File:Aimed_Bolt.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2236/aimed-bolt Aimed Bolt]
| Fires an arrow that deals multiple hits if the target is immobilised by Warg Bite, Ankle Snare or Electric Shock. Immobilise effect is removed when the target receives damage.&lt;br>
Small: 2~3 hits, Medium: 3~4 hits, Large: 4~5 hits
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Commonly used skill for boss fighting during instances with a party. Viable DPS skill under Magic Strings.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Almost similar to the above, but the downside is that it is single target unlike Arrow Storm.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> Using {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Dex Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes }} with 120 base DEX will remove the fixed cast time associated with the skill.
|-
||[[File:Trap_Research.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2248/trap-research Trap Research]
| Increases the cast range of trap skills, gives additional damage to traps, increases SP and gives bonus INT.
| &lt;b>PvM/PvP:&lt;/b> You can add this for a nice SP boost and INT to get instant cast more easily.
|-
||[[File:Camouflage.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2247/camouflage Camouflage]
| Puts you in a "cloaked" state, can be toggled. While in the Camouflage state, you gain Crit and ATK over time which is cancelled on your next attack or when the duration ends. You cannot be targeted while in Camouflage.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Very useful to maneuver around maps when you do not want to deal with mobs and is a viable way of resetting mob aggro.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Since most Rangers typically run Bow builds, Camouflage significantly increases the chances of survival.
|-
||[[File:Arrow_Storm.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2233/arrow-storm Arrow Storm]
| Deals huge physical ranged damage in an AoE (11x11 at level 10).
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> The go-to skill for farming in mobby areas and in general for mob clearing in instances.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> The go-to skill due to its AoE, but has trouble doing good damage unless using Unlimit or having very good gears.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> {{Item List |id=15042 |item=White Wing Suits |slot=1 |simple=yes }} set increases the damage by 50%. {{Item List |id=18110 |item=Big Crossbow |slots=2 |simple=yes }} increases Arrow Storm damage by 5% per refine.

[[File:Verdure_Trap.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2252/verdure-trap Verdure Trap]
| Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=7940 |item=Special Alloy Trap |simple=yes }} and 1 Indigo/Scarlett/Lime Green/Yellow Wish Point respectively. Place a trap that will activate in 3x3 AoE and change the element of the monster to Water/Fire/Earth/Wind respectively. Does not work on bosses and players.
| &lt;b>PvM only.&lt;/b> Can be very helpful for running parties in gramps when you can streamline the elemental property of the mobs in the area.
&lt;b>Did You Know?&lt;/b> The Point Merchant can be found at Prontera (/navi prontera 181/216).
|-
||[[File:Fire_Trap.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2253/fire-trap Fire Trap]
| Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=7940 |item=Special Alloy Trap |simple=yes }}. Place a trap that will activate in a 5x5 AoE to deal Fire property damage and has a chance (increases per level) to inflict Burning status on enemies. Can be placed under targets.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Using this skill together with Maze Trap will allow you to kill mobs quickly.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> This skill can be very annoying for players to deal with because of the Burning duration while you can simply wear reduction gears to be tanky.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> Autumn Headband (@ii2 5898) will increase the damage of Ice/Fire Trap by 50% and a further 50% at +9.
|-
||[[File:Ice_Trap.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2254/ice-trap Ice Trap]
| Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=7940 |item=Special Alloy Trap |simple=yes }}. Place a trap that will activate in a 5x5 AoE to deal Water property damage and has a chance (increases per level) to inflict Freezing status on enemies. Can be placed under targets.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Using this skill together with Magenta Trap will allow you to kill mobs quickly.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> This skill can be very annoying for players to deal with because of the Freezing status which slows their movement speed down greatly while you can simply wear reduction gears to be tanky.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> Autumn Headband (@ii2 5898) will increase the damage of Ice/Fire Trap by 50% and a further 50% at +9.
|-
||[[File:Warg_Strike.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2243/warg-strike Warg Strike]
| Deals ranged &lt;b>Forced Neutral&lt;/b> damage to your target which ignores Racial and Size reductions. Does not scale with ranged, race, element or size modifiers. Has a (LUK/3)% chance of activating when auto attacking. Can be used when mounted on Warg. Jumps to the target when mounted.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Mostly used for Auto Warg builds. Typically maxed if not in a Aimed Bolt build.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be used in a tanky build with Combat Knife as weapon of choice. Mounted and un-mounted usage are both viable here.
|-
||[[File:Warg_Bite.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2244/warg-bite Warg Bite]
| Deals damage to enemies and has a chance to Immobilise them for a duration. Higher levels increases the base Immobilise duration and success chance. Success chance is reduced by target's AGI and cannot go below 50%. Cooldown increases per level.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be kind of difficult to use since you are mobbing most of the time.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be useful to immobilise players, especially low AGI classes to prevent them from chasing you.
|-
||[[File:Tooth_of_Warg.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2245/warg-teeth Tooth of Warg]
| Increases the damage of Warg skills. +(30 x skill lv) ATK for Warg skills.
| &lt;b>PvM/PvP:&lt;/b> Max this if you are going to use Warg related skills.
|-

| Toggle skill. Mount or unmount your Warg. Increases your movement speed per level. You can use Warg Strike, Warg Dash and trap skills while mounted.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Generally maxed to move around quickly.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Optional to add as you cannot be in Camouflage and mounted at the same time.
|-
||[[File:Sensitive_Keen.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2246/keen-nose Sensitive Keen]
| Use your Warg to sense traps and hidden enemies in the area. AoE increases per level (15x15 AoE at level 5) and has a chance to cast Warg Bite (40% at level 5).
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be an alternative method to detect enemies.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Especially useful to disarm traps in the area, can be spammed under Magic Strings.

Wanderers and Maestros are one of the top supportive classes in Ragnarok aside from Arch Bishops due to their powerful song/dance abilities. Wanderers and Maestros also have gained new buff and debuff abilities apart from their 2nd job and transcendent ones.

&lt;u>Legend&lt;/u>&lt;br>
W: Wanderer, M: Maestro, WM = Wanderer/Maestro&lt;br>
----
&lt;b>Note:&lt;/b> Maestro/Wanderer songs can be classified under Group A or Group B except Frigg's Song which has no group. Using a song under the same group will replace the current one. This is especially useful for removing debuffs. Chorus songs require 2 or more Performers and do not have the same restrictions like Ensembles where you require 1 of each class eg. Having 2 Maestro will allow the use of Chorus skills.

| &lt;b>No Group.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=6144 |item=Regrettable Tears |simple=yes }}. Increases %MHP and give HP regen in an AoE (+25% MHP and 180HP/s in 15x15 AoE at level 5).
| &lt;b>PvM/PvP:&lt;/b> Max this. The HP boost is pretty difficult to pass up on in general, especially useful for tanking or classes that scale well with HP like Rune Knights.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>WM&lt;/div>
| Requires equipped Instrument. Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=11513 |item=Throat Lozenge |simple=yes }} Places a 'note' on the ground which will snare the first enemy that enters its 3x3 AoE. Up to 5 unactivated 'notes' may be casted. Duration increases per level. Does not work on bosses.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Not very useful in most situations due to mobbing.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be pretty useful to place them on choke points or predicting where your enemy will walk.

| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can have pretty interesting results for removing aggro.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Suggested to max as you can avoid being targeted. This can also help you avoid getting Cursed Circled.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>WM&lt;/div>

| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be useful for the %ASPD and Flee reduction especially on bosses.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Useful to have maxed to slow enemy players down.

| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Your main leveling skill. Max this.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Not recommended for PvP as you better serve a supportive role. Using a bow will also gimp your survivability.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> +7 &lt;b>Lyrica Hat&lt;/b> (@ii2 5905) for Maestro or +7 &lt;b>Night Sparrow Hat&lt;/b> (@ii2 18796) increases the damage of Severe Rainstorm by 25%.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>WM&lt;/div>
| Deals magic damage to your target and drains their SP. Damage is increased if the target was under Sleep or Deep Sleep. 
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Not commonly used as Severe Rainstorm provides more AoE.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> It is possible to deal damage with this but it has a cooldown, making it a skill that is more focused on draining SP.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> You can equip 2 {{Item List |id=2899 |item=Sound Amplifier |slots=1 |simple=yes }} for a total of 300% increase in damage for Metallic Sound.

| &lt;b>PvM/PvP:&lt;/b> Very useful to buff the damage of Warg Strike for Warg-focused Ranger builds.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>WM&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group B Chorus.&lt;/b> Increases SP recovery of party memebers in the AoE (19x19 at level 5).
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Pretty good for helping with SP sustainability when doing stuff like Gramps or farming.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Hardly used as there are probably other more useful Chorus songs to use like Dance with Wug.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>W&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group A.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Increases the movement speed of party members in an AoE (23x23 at level 5) greatly and increases %ASPD.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Generally useful for having Speed Potion-like movement speed and the ASPD boost.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Situationally useful, but most are expected to be using Speed Potions.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>W&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group A.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Increases the MATK of party members in an AoE (23x23 at level 5).
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be useful if you have a lot of magic-type classes, but you'll more often have physical classes.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Useful to buff your Warlocks with this song for more damage.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>W&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group A.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Increases the %MDEF of party members in an AoE (23x23 at level 5) for 60s.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Not very useful as most monsters do not spam magic attacks.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be useful to hit 100 MDEF for Frozen and Stone immunity.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>M&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group A.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Increases the %DEF of party members in an AoE (23x23 at level 5) for 60s.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be pretty useful to boost the DEF of your party generally since monsters often use normal attacks.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be useful to reduce physical damage.
|-

| &lt;div align='center'>M&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group A.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Reduces all stats (-30 at level 5) of both target and caster for 60s. &lt;b>Negates the effects of foods and other buffs which give stat point bonuses.&lt;/b>
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be used against bosses to lower their stats slightly.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Useful against classes that rely a lot on stats for damage/effectiveness such as Genetics and Chasers.
|-
||[[File:Windmill_Rush.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2381/windmill-rush Windmill Rush]
| &lt;div align='center'>M&lt;/div>
| &lt;b>Group A.&lt;/b> Requires an equipped Instrument. Increases the ATK of party members in an AoE (23x23 at level 5) for 60s.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Decent buff for your party members since most classes deal physical damage.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> This might be the preferred buff for some but I think the Wanderer MDEF, Maestro DEF buffs could be more useful sometimes.

|-

| Ground targeted spell that deals Water property damage in 7x7 AoE and has a chance to Crystallise. Higher skill levels increases the success rate of Crystallise. Base Vit reduces the duration of this effect.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> This skill is usually added as it's the only Water damaging spell by default. It's also used in spell rotations. Monsters do not get Crystallised though.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> This skill is mostly used for Crystallise, which is one of the strongest disables in the game because it prevents targets under the effect to use items.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> Call Aqua Level 2 in Passive Mode increases the rate of inflicting Crystallise.
|-
||[[File:Warmer.png]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2452/warmer Warmer]
| Ground targeted spell that creates a 7x7 AoE region which will remove and prevent Crystallisation, Freezing and Frozen effects. Anyone in the AoE regenerates 1% MHP per skill level every 3s. Does not affect Undead element targets.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Very helpful as a regeneration skill and to prevent Frozen especially in instances like Demon God.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Strong regeneration on defense which can also heal barricades very quickly.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> Call Agni level 2 in Passive Mode increases the regeneration amount.

| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Your primary damage spell due to it being the hardest hitting spell and the ability to endow it via your elemental summon.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> One of your options in dealing damage but this is mostly paired with Crystallise + Wind Psychic Wave to capitalise on Crystallise's bonus when dealing Wind damage.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tip:&lt;/b> {{Item List |id=1654 |item=Mental Stick |slots=1 |simple=yes }} increases the damage of Psychic Wave by 2% per refine past +6.
|-

| Creates a vacuum that snares targets in an AoE (7x7 at level 5). Skill level increases the snare duration. Base STR reduces the duration of the effect. 
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Powerful crowd control tool to keep your character safe to cast and kill mobs.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Powerful crowd control tool to keep your enemies in place and this is sometimes combo-ed with Bloody Lust (targets in AoE are in LK Frenzy state) to prevent them from removing it.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Did you know?&lt;/b> A Guillotine Cross under Hallucination Walk can ignore the effects of Extreme Vacuum.

| Consumes 1~3 Scarlett/Indigo/Yellow Wish/Lime Green Point respectively based on the level of the skill used.&lt;br> Creates a 3x3 AoE ground effect that gives certain bonuses. Each skill level gives a different bonus. Notable common effects: Anyone under a particular insignia will receive 50% more damage from its opposing element, eg. targets in Earth Insignia take 50% more Fire property damage.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Can be used in instances to further increase the damage dealt to bosses that are already weak to particular elements. Up to level 2 is added usually for its endow effect.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Can be used defensively in front of pre-cast to improve the damage of allies. The damage receive increase also applies to allies in the AoE. Usually level 1 is sufficient.
|-

| Consumes 1 {{Item List |id=717 |item=Blue Gemstone |simple=yes }} and the currently summoned Elemental to cast Pneuma + Safety Wall on every person in your party within your screen. Duration increases per level. &lt;b>No cooldown, but summons have cooldown.&lt;/b>
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> I never see this being used in PvM because there's no real need to use this at all.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Very powerful skill to use especially in WoE to counter Suicidal Destruction and just before a clash. Usually level 1 is sufficient.
|-

| Switches the mode of your Elemental summon. Reusing the same level twice returns the Elemental to its rest mode where it can regen HP/SP.&lt;br>
Level 1: Passive Mode, Level 2: Defensive Mode, Level 3: Offensive Mode, Level 4: Waiting Mode
| &lt;b>PvM/PvP:&lt;/b> Generally added up to level 2 but level 3 is required for Elemental Shield.

Notable effects: &lt;b>Level 1 Defensive Mode&lt;/b> increases movement speed greatly, &lt;b>Level 2 Defensive Mode&lt;/b> gives +100% wind resistance but -100% earth resistance, &lt;b>Level 2 Passive Mode&lt;/b> endows Psychic Wave with Wind element.
| &lt;b>PvM:&lt;/b> Level 1 Defense Mode can be useful for kiting in general, while Level 2 Passive Mode is most frequently used for DPSing.&lt;br>
&lt;b>PvP:&lt;/b> Some players may opt for Level 1 Defense Mode to move around the map quickly, or otherwise use Level 2 Passive Mode for occasional DPS.

I'd like to thank Gravity for creating this awesome game, the people who have taken the time to point out some of the mistakes I made along the way and the contributors of the wiki who have given me a lot of references on how I can format my guide.&lt;br>

Do drop me a PM on forums if you spot any errors or want to give feedback, it is very much appreciated.
