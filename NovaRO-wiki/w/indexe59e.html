=='''''Overview'''''==
&lt;br>
Hey, I am making this guide as a way of sharing what I know and hopefully would help you understand the mechanics of the class and enjoy it. The gears, items and builds showcased in this guide does not mean it is the best of all builds but more of a basis for you to make your own better version.

&lt;br>
=='''''Starting the Sura Way of Life'''''==
First of all when making a Sura, one must have a good name and you will probably need 2 to 3 hours thinking of one. Second, you need good costumes too, it's either go full edgy or go cute because in Nova it is a sin to have no costumes. (If you die in a party, the Priest will use {{Item List |id=610 |item=get good costume leaf |simple=yes|}} instead of {{Skill List |id=54 |skill=Ressurect |simple=yes}} if you have bad costumes. Trust me.)
I just want to share to you that having good costumes actually give you bonus stats.&lt;br>
* Increased Farming Time&lt;br>
* Increased Invitation Requests&lt;br>
* Decreases Gaming Fatigue&lt;br>
* You get Sugar Daddies&lt;br>

&lt;br>
Lastly, please be respectful to other players and be kind. This is only a game.
&lt;br>

|-
||'''STR'''
|| Each point of STR adds:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/ATK#Status_ATK Status ATK]
* +30 Weight Limit
* +0.5% Weapon Atk
|| Main stat for increasing your damage. This stat affects the "melee" physical damage of the player. Placing points into STR increases the players damage(Atk). For every point of STR provides an increase in Weight Limit of 30 and Status ATK by 1.
|-
||'''AGI'''
|| Each point of AGI adds:
* +1 Flee
* Increases Attack Speed
* -1% Resistance to Bleeding
* -1% Sleep Resistance&lt;br>
Every 5 points adds:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/DEF#Soft_DEF Soft DEF]&lt;br>
Every 1 - 20 points adds:
* 1 ASPD
|| The speed of the character is improved with this stat. AGI increases the players attack speed, flee rate, animation speed, and some status ailment resistance. Increasing attack-speed(ASPD) by 1 would need about 1 - 20 points into AGI but the actual calculation will depend on the gears and potion you are using. Most of Sura's skills are affected by animation delay thus having Agi into your build is essential.
|-
||'''VIT'''
|| Each point of VIT adds:
* +1% Max HP
* +2% Healing from items&lt;br>
Every 2 points adds:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/DEF#Soft_DEF Soft DEF]&lt;br>
Every 5 points adds:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/MDEF#Soft_MDEF Soft MDEF]
|| The VIT stat is one of the core stats for a Sura, this skill increases the damage output of {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} (via bonus damage). For every point of VIT, Health, Defense, Status Resistance, and Healing Effectiveness is increased.&lt;br>
* Poison -1% chance of being inflicted
* Stun -1% chance of being inflicted
* Deadly Poison -1% chance of being inflicted
* Burning = reduces chance of being inflicted, reduces duration by 0.1
* Freezing = reduces chance of being inflicted, reduces duration by 0.1
|-
||'''INT'''
||Each point of INT adds:
* +1.5 MATK
* +1% Max SP
* +1% SP restoration from items&lt;br>
Every 2 points adds:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/MDEF#Soft_MDEF Soft MDEF]&lt;br>
Decreases [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#CastTime Variable Cast Time]
|| INT stat is also one of the stats that increase the damage output of {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}}. This stat reduces the VCT (Variable Cast Time) of some skills, specially {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2518 |skill=Lightning Ride |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2517 |skill=Lion's Howl |simple=yes}}. Also, one of the best part of this skill is that this increases the effectiveness of healing items.
|-
||'''DEX'''
||Each point of DEX adds:
* +1 Hit&lt;br>
Every 5 points of DEX add:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/ATK#Status_ATK Status ATK]
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/MDEF#Soft_MDEF Soft MDEF]&lt;br>
Decreases [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#CastTime Variable Cast Time]&lt;br>
Increases your [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Attack_Speed ASPD]
|| Dex stat is the main status that increases ATK of "Ranged" attack, and also slightly increases "Melee" attack. This is the main Stat to decrease Variable Cast Time (VCT). VCT Equation (100%) 540 = (1x)INT + (2x)DEX.
|-
||'''LUK'''
||Each point of LUK adds:
* +0.3% Crit Rate&lt;br>
Every 3 points of LUK add:
* +1 ATK
* +1 Hit&lt;br>
Every 5 points of LUK add:
* +1 Flee
* +1% Critical Hit Shield&lt;br>
Every 10 points of LUK add:
* +1 Perfect Dodge
|| Either get 0 points for this STAT to obtain Curse immunity or get 100 points (To be able to attain 0, you need to equip at least one Essence of Evil Dex 3.) LUK also give Atk which is noticeable in the endgame scenarios where you min/max your gears and damage. I suggest taking no LUK when leveling up but make sure to have at least 80 points into this when reaching max level.

Note: The Stone status effect is a two-stage effect. When a character is first inflicted with the Stone status, they are still able to move, and being attacked does not cancel the effect - note that during this time they can be effected by Lex Aeterna, and cannot attack or use skills but still able to use items. Once the Stone "hardens," the character is immobilized, and being attacked will break the Stone curse.&lt;br>

&lt;br>
For a more specific and up to date outcome of a '''broke''' starting sura plater, I highly recommend you watch this series of videos. &lt;br>
:'''https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxbKphU3LmM&amp;list=PLt6r0wsrkzlZTe56wQPkY8IjX9QmeeYfC'''
This series showcases a good item progression and quest line progression which I highly recommend you follow also.&lt;br>
When starting the game you are teleported into a space where there is a warp portal, you have the option to follow the guide or just skip in entirely.
If you plan on skipping the guide just type [@go geffen], click on the Kafra and cick save.&lt;br>
===='''Levels 0 - 15'''====
* Look at the mini-map on the top right corner of the screen and you can see red dots which signify warp portals. Move to the Left portal.
* Press (alt+A) to view your Status Window, place all your stat points into DEX. Make sure your character has Auto-Attack on. Type /nc and the message window will notify you whether it is on or off.
* Look for {{Monster List |id=1230 |name=Pupa |simple=yes}} in the map and only kill this monster. Warning: If you hit other types of monsters you will instantly die.
* After Killing 2x {{Monster List |id=1230 |name=Pupa |simple=yes}} you will instantly get max Job Level which enables you to change your job to Acolyte.
* Open Skill Window via (alt+S) and use all your skill points.
* On the message box, type [@go main]. This will teleport you directly into the Main Office.
* Talk to the Job Change NPC on the lower left corner of the Map. Beside the Job Change NPC is the Daily Rewards NPC which you should never forget to talk to after an Hour everyday to receive your Rewards.
* After changing to Acolyte Class, open your equipment window [alt+E] and double click on the {{Item List |id=29669 |item=Novice Package |simple=yes}} which the game gives you. You will receive {{Item List |id=501 |item=Red Potion |simple=yes}} and an {{Item List |id=28608 |item=Ring of Experience |simple=yes}}. Place your Red Potions on your Skill Tab which is found when clicking F12. Place this on the F1 slot.
* Teleport back to Geffen via [@go Geffen]. 
* Go back to the Left Warp area where you killed the {{Monster List |id=1230 |name=Pupa |simple=yes}} and this time also kill {{Monster List |id=3386 |name=Fabre |simple=yes}}. When you reach level 10, try hitting {{Monster List |id=3384 |name=Poring |simple=yes}}. Place your stat points into DEX and STR. Level your {{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Increase Agility |simple=yes}} to Max to give you Movespeed and Attackspeed.
* Go back to Geffen, and move to the North Warp portal. Here you will find {{Monster List |id=1020 |name=Mandragora |simple=yes}} and {{Monster List |id=3386 |name=Fabre |simple=yes}}, make sure to kill it without other {{Monster List |id=1020 |name=Mandragora |simple=yes}} beside it or you will get overwhelmed with the damage (these monsters have high range).
* Keep on Killing these monsters until you hit level 26&lt;br>

From here you need to obtain the Eden Group Equipment&lt;br>

* Type [@go Eden] and talk to Secretary Lime > Join the Eden Group > Input your Name then talk to Instructor Boya > Choose 2nd Option (Participate), which is found beside Secretary Lim. (orange ponytail). 
* Instructor Boya will require you to kill some monsters as a requirement for the gears.
* Click on [Warper Npc] and go to [Payon Dungeon]. Exit the dungeon by walking to the [Warper] next to you. Talk to [Eden Member - Karl]. The Npc will require you to Kill 15x {{Monster List |id=1076 |name=Skeleton |simple=yes}} and 10x {{Monster List |id=1031 |name=Poporing |simple=yes}} . After killing these monsters, go back to [Karl] to submit your Quest and receive your reward.
* Karl sends you back to Boya > Boya tells you to go to Storage Room which is inside the blue door beside the quest boards > Take the right portal and talk to Administrator Michael. Choose the Eden Group Mace as Weapon of Choice.
* From here on out put your Stats on STR, AGI, DEX. At this point you will be between level 39 - 42. Go to the second map of [Payon Dungeon].
* Move to the next Warp. Be careful with {{Monster List |id=1420 |name=Archer Skeleton |simple=yes}} since they will hit really hard. Do not forget to open your leveling chests to obtain your Healing Potions.
* When you reach level 49 proceed to the next level of [Payon Dungeon] where you will find {{Monster List |id=1026 |name=Munak |simple=yes}} and {{Monster List |id=1611 |name=Bongun |simple=yes}}. By the time you reach Job Level 50 your Base level will be around 55 - 58.
* Upon reaching these levels you are now able to obtain the quest for Eden Equipment III which is quite easy for levels 50 - 59.
* Go back to Eden > Talk To Boya > Go to Teleporter > warp to [Orc Dungeon] > Go inside the Warp Portal above you > Talk to the NPC named [Hooksha] > You are then tasked to kill 20x {{Monster List |id=1463 |name=Orc Zombie|simple=yes}} and 20x {{Monster List |id=1152 |name=Orc Skeleton |simple=yes}}.
* When completing the quests and obtaining the new Eden Gears, you will probably be at Base Level 70 - 75.&lt;br>

Nova Ext Settings
* When playing Monk Combos, you will need to use the NovaExt Settings to make combo easier and convenient.
* Find a bar where you dedicate your combo skills.&lt;br>
For me, I rename the skill bars from F1 - f12 into 1 to 12, and 1 - 12 to Q-P, and so on since I find it hard to press F1 on the keyboard.&lt;br>
This can be changed in the BM/Shortcut Settings.&lt;br>
Place Chain Combo Skill on the the first slot and change its behavior to (Turbo).&lt;br>
* What this does is it makes it easier for you to time the skill. You just Auto-attack and hold down the {{Skill List |id=272 |skill=Chain Combo |simple=yes}} and it automatically activates and then you just need to time {{Skill List |id=273 |skill=Combo Finish |simple=yes}} Also or you can hold down Combo Finish and it also automatically activates.&lt;br>
** Hold Down All Buttons (Turbo Mode) while Auto Attacking >> {{Skill List |id=272 |skill=Chain Combo |simple=yes}} + {{Skill List |id=273 |skill=Combo Finish |simple=yes}} + {{Skill List |id=372 |skill=Chain Crush Combo |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
'''Note:''' {{Skill List |id=273 |skill=Combo Finish |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=372 |skill=Chain Crush Combo |simple=yes}} consumes Spirit Sphere so be sure to keep refreshing your spheres.&lt;br>

*Use {{Skill List |id=270 |skill=Critical Explosion |simple=yes}} to Get More Critical Chance&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=261 |skill=Call Spirits |simple=yes}} 5x > {{Skill List |id=270 |skill=Critical Explosion |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
When changing to Champion Class, you get access to {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}} which is a much easier way of getting spheres.&lt;br>
**{{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=270 |skill=Critical Explosion |simple=yes}}
&lt;br>
Continue The Grind To 100&lt;br>
* Upon obtaining the new Eden Gears > Go back to Eden > Talk to the Level 71 - 85 Board Quest > Take Glast Heim > Hunt {{Monster List |id=1475|name=Wraith |simple=yes}} and {{Monster List |id=1117 |name=Evil Druid |simple=yes}}.
* Go to Teleporter > Warp To Glast Heim > Glast Heim St. Abbey > Complete The Quest.
* The Board Quest is repeatable so just keep on doing it until you reach level 85. (Perks of farming St. Abbey is that the monsters drop Books which sell for 35,000.00).
* When reaching level 85+ take the Gramps Quest from the quest board found on the top left corner of Eden.
* Wait for a party and just join. Upon joining a party, you will most likely reach max level before even completing the quest. '''(Do not leave the party or change your class before completing the Quest)'''.
* When you complete the Quest '''(DO NOT TURN-IN THE QUEST TO THE BOARD YET)'''.
* Go to the Main Office [@go Main] > use all your skills > talk to the Class NPC > rebirth to High Novice etc.
* Go to Geffen [@go Geffen] > put everything on DEX > go to the left warp portal > kill the {{Monster List |id=1230 |name=Pupa |simple=yes}} monsters until you reach Job Level 10.
* Change to High Acolyte > restart client and relogin back into your character > go back to Eden > '''SLOWLY''' talk to the Board Quest Giver to submit "ONLY 1" quest > you will notice you will level up to near Max, this means you submitted the first quest > after submitting one quest press '''alt+f4''' since you are locked in the dialog.
* Relogin back into your character which will be probably at max level. If your character did not reach max level from that quest, go to [Warper] > go to [Gonryun Dungeon] > kill some monsters until you reach max level.
* Go back to Main Office > Use up all your skill points > Change to Champion > If your character did not reach max level from the first quest. > Go to Eden > Go to 2nd Floor > Take level 91 - 99 Quest > Glast Heim > {{Monster List |id=1201 |name=Rybio |simple=yes}} and {{Monster List |id=1446 |name=Injustice |simple=yes}}
* Go to Warper > Go to Glast Heim Castle > Go to the Top Right Entrance > Reach Max Level and also farm at the same time.
* Go back to Eden > Sumbit your second Quest > Go back to Main Office > if you did not get enough levels then go back to killing monsters > Change to Sura Class > Restart Client > Farm back to either Gonryun Dungeon or Glast Heim.&lt;br>

Beware of {{Item List |id=660 |item=Forbidden Red Candle |simple=yes}} dropped by {{Monster List |id=1446 |name=Injustice |simple=yes}}. These items sell for 5m each.&lt;br>
Make sure to learn level 2 {{Skill List |id=27 |skill=Warp Portal |simple=yes}}. When you reach the destination place, type /memo so that you wont need to walk back again when you die.&lt;br>

Leveling from 100 - 200&lt;br>

From here on out I suggest farming Gonryun to earn money so that you could slowly upgrade your gears.&lt;br>
Gears to buy on your priority list shall be:&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=1839 |item=Crimson Knuckle (Fire) |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin (STR) |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=22006 |item=Temporal Boots (STR) (FS) (Any) |simple=yes}}&lt;br>

These gears are needed so that you could farm Gonryun Dungeon faster. These are not necessarily needed but they will help increase your damage.&lt;br>

When reaching Job Levels 10 - 15 you could learn more Sura skills.&lt;br>
Gears to get shall be:&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=1836 |item=Thanatos Knuckle |slots=1 |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin (STR) |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=4588 |item=Wakwak Card |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List |id=22006 |item=Temporal Boots (STR) (FS) (Any) |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
Get this without refines. (These give really good +ATK which increases your damage by a lot.
* {{Item List2 |id=15090 |item=Lava Leather Armor +0 |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List2 |id=15091 |item=Lava Leather Suit +0|simple=yes}}&lt;br>
* {{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor A +0 |simple=yes}}&lt;br>

Skills to prioritize will be:&lt;br>

* {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earth Shaker |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
**This skill will now be your main damage skill, the skill damage scales on your ATK. (This is why I am recommending ATK gears as your starting priority).
* {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Blow |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
**This will be your secondary skill or a filler skill when Earth Shaker is on cool-down.&lt;br>	
These skills will be your main farming and leveling skills until you reach level 160+ and have more money.&lt;br>

'''Note:''' If you like the game, I suggest helping Nova by buying Nova Points. This way you could earn fast money by selling NP vouchers. =) (Simp!)

‘’’If you’re and experienced player then I don’t think you would still need this.’’’
My way of leveling my characters is to make two accounts. The main account is where my Sura is and the second account I make a Rebel. I level them both using the Sura as the leecher.&lt;br>
: - '''For 0 - 85''': I max out desperado and bring grape juices with me and kill mobs 1 map above Geffen. All you need are bullets for your Rebel.
::*Reach levels 20 - 30 before moving to a new map which spawns Poison Spores.
:::*(This is 1 map above Geffen and 1 map right.)
::*Reach level 40 - 50 and move to Orc Dungeon.
:::*(Make sure to bring more SP pots and Holy Bullets.)
::*Reach level 75 - 80 and take board quests from eden.
:::*(Quest in Old Glast Heim that requires you to kill Wraiths, and Evil Druids)
: - When you reach level 85 you can then do gramps party.&lt;br>
: - when you finish doing the gramps quest, follow these steps.&lt;br>
::*'''NOTE: DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR QUESTS''' to the gramps board yet.&lt;br>
::**After your gramps run, you will likely reach max job and base level.&lt;br>
::**Go to (Main Office) to change your job to High Novice.&lt;br>
::**Go back to (Eden) and submit '''ONLY ONE QUEST'''.&lt;br>
::***Do not spam the enter key while talking to the board.&lt;br>
::**Once you receive the levels and exp from the 1st quest, press '''ALT+F4'''&lt;br>
::***If you do not reach max base and job levels from the first quest, join a level 85 gramps party to leech exp until you level to max.&lt;br>
::**Go to (Main Office) to change job and submit your remaining gramps quest to receive your rewards.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
When you become a Sura, the farming starts when you obtain the Sky Blow skill. The following guide is unconventional since we are a unique class that is hard to play and farm with. Our class shines best on maps that are filled with monsters, we love mobbing and we love the sound of that BOOM from our skills. The best way to level a Sura is to farm with a Sura. You will need some core items to be able to solo farm effectively.&lt;br> 
: - While waiting for the gramps quest to cool-down, go to (Magma Dungeon 2) to level and farm at the same time.&lt;br>
::*Learn {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Blow |simple=yes}}. This will be your main farming skill at the moment.&lt;br>
::*During these stage of your level, try to save money as much as possible from Magma Dungeon 2 drops.&lt;br>
::Buy these items first:&lt;br>
:::*{{Item List |id=16028 |item=Thanatos Hammer |slots=1 |simple=yes}} - (Can be obtainable through running Ghost Palace instance which is really easy.)&lt;br>
:::*{{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} - (Best headgear for farming.)&lt;br>
:::*{{Item List |id=16040 |item=Crimson Mace |slots=2 |simple=yes}} - (If you can't wear a Thanatos weapon yet, use the crimson mace instead. Get neutral element.)&lt;br>
:::*{{Item List |id=16033 |item=Robot Mechanical Arm |slots=2 |simple=yes}} - (Use this instead of a Crimson Mace if you ever get one for a cheap price since this weapon has better base damage. Can only be used at 130+)&lt;br>
:::*{{Card |id=4115 Hunter Fly Card}} - (Use 1, 2, 3 or 4 of these cards. Really really good for farming.)&lt;br>
:::*{{Item List |id=9055 |item=Succubus |simple=yes}} - (Want more HP leech?)&lt;br>
&lt;br>
: '''- For 85 - 115''': You can actually leech your Sura to Gramps 85 if you learn Fire Dance skill.
:If you cannot, join a lvl 85 Gramps Party.
:If you finish a gramps party but still want to gain more levels, I suggest you go to these dungeons.
::*Glast Heim St. Abbey (you can go to this dungeon via Warper NPC)
:::-Go to Eden, get board quest for Wraith and Evil Druid. If your level is higher than the maximum required level for the quest, you can still go to the dungeon and farm the exp.
::*Magma Dungeon 1
:::-I suggest you max your skill {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Blow |simple=yes}}. Farm the dungeon and sell the loots.
::*Glast Heim Under-prison ('''[http://ratemyserver.net/npc_shop_warp.php?map=gl_prison&amp;re_mob=0&amp;small=1 Glast Heim Underprison]''')
:::-Use a holy/fire elemental weapon or {{Item List |id=12114 |item=Elemental Converter (Fire) |simple=yes}}
::*Gonryun Dungeon 1
:::-Use Fire Element weapon
:::-The monsters here hits pretty hard so I suggest you take precaution.
:::-The loots are very nice. 
&lt;br>
: - '''For 115 - 145''', whenever you finish gramps party go to Abyss Lake Dungeon 1.
::*For this dungeon you will need to learn {{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon Lvl 10 |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}}.
:::-Make sure to lure a good amount of monsters before using Rampage Blaster.
:::-Use Rideword Hat, Hunter Fly, Thanatos Hammer, and Succubus pet to survive.
::*You can also move up to Abyss Lake Dungeon 2 or 3 for a more denser map.
::*Try to focus on farming during this stage of level and in no time you will reach 145 in no time. The more you keep on farming maps with dense monster population the faster you gain EXP.
::*During this stage, try to practice your combos and movements.
&lt;br>
: - '''For 145 - 175''', this stage will be easier since you have more powerful skills unlocked at your disposal.
::*Move up to Abyss Lake 3 and start farming loots and exp there.
:::Max out the skill {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} , {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon Lv 10 |simple=yes}} , and {{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon Lvl 10 |simple=yes}}. If you cant one-shot the monsters in Abyss 3, try to combine your skills. {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} with {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} and snap away.
::*Farming really hard hitting monsters will be your training ground as a PvE Sura.
::*I suggest you farm up the minimum required gears for you to farm OGH Norm solo.&lt;br>
:::-Rideword Hat
:::-Thanatos Hammer (Pom Spider Card) for the Undead zombies.
:::-Thanatos Knuckle (Kaho Card) for the maggots.
:::-Glorious Suit
:::-Temporal Boots of Str (Fighting Spirit/Green Ferus Card)
:::-Giant Snake Skin (Str/Vit/Vit) (Wakwak card)
:::-Succubus Pet
:::Before jumping into the bodies with maggots make sure you buff up with extra foods. Always use {{Item List |id=12424 |item=HP Increase Potion (Large) |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=12030 |item=Box of Resentment |simple=yes}}. Be sure to use '''Fire Element against the Maggots''' get a {{Item List |id=12114 |item=Elemental Converter (Fire) |simple=yes}} if necessary.&lt;br>

: - '''For 150 - 175.'''
::*If you feel confident in your skills, you can try and solo gramps 145. Try to identify the monsters you are fighting and use the proper element to increase your damage against them.
::*Gramps 145 monsters are pretty tanky, so try to use the element they are weak to for the best results.
::*If gramps is too tanky, then I would recommend going back to Abyss Lake 3. You receive less exp due to level difference but the density of the monsters will compensate you for it.
:::For Abyss Lake 3, you will need to use {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} with {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} to farm it fast. Always lean more to HP leech than to damage.
: - You will reach level 175 in no time.

Sura is one of the best class to farm with for specific monsters, sometimes we do better than others and sometimes we fail to even do a proper farming run. Our class will excel only if we gear and build it properly. We cannot rely on a single build alone to farm efficiently compared to most classes, instead we adapt to become better. We must use the skills that give advantage to our class in terms of farming and strength. I will list some of the Monsters, Dungeons, and Instances that Sura is better at farming.&lt;br>
====Low Level Monsters====
&lt;br>
:'''Orc Dungeon'''
::What to farm:
:::{{Item List |id=12027 |item=HP Giggling Box |simple=yes}} drops from undead monsters. You can do this by equipping ({{Item List |id=4190 |item=Wraith Card |simple=yes}}).
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} with {{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation  |simple=yes}}
::Gears to use:
:::Gears that are carded with {{Item List |id=4606 | item=Grudge of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} for garment and {{Item List |id=4605 | item=Agony of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} for armor. This is to ensure you do not lose SP and HP while farming.
&lt;br>
:'''Magma Dungeon 2'''
::What to farm:
:::Farm everything that drops from the dungeon and sell them to npc. Also you can farm {{Item List |id=12030 |item=Box of Resentment |simple=yes}} since some of the monsters are Demon Type. You can do this by equipping {{Item List |id=4187 |item=Raydric Archer Card |simple=yes}}.
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2517 |skill=Howling of Lion |simple=yes}}.
::Gears to use:
:::Garment carded with {{Item List |id=4606 | item=Grudge of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} for SP and armor with {{Item List |id=4605 | item=Agony of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}}. Weapon with Holy Element.
&lt;br>
:'''Dewata Dungeon 2'''
::What to farm:
:::{{Item List |id=756 |item=Rough Oridecon |simple=yes}}, gather 5 stones to create 1 {{Item List |id=984 |item=Oridecon |simple=yes}}. Go to (Hakhim) near the payon blacksmith to convert your stones. Also, since the monsters are Demon Type, you can also farm {{Item List |id=12030 |item=Box of Resentment |simple=yes}} at the same time.
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2336 |skill=Knuckle Arrow |simple=yes}} will be your main killing skill and {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} will be second just to fill your SP. Knuckle Arrow is a ranged skill and Grudge of Royal Knight Card will not work.
::Gears to use:
:::{{Item List |id=4606 | item=Grudge of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} , {{Item List |id=4308 | item=Tri Joint Card | simple=yes}} for weapon, Water Element Weapon, equip gears that replenish SP as much as possible or set your build to high INT so that Grape Juice will heal more SP. Also, get gears that increase Movement Speed like Runaway Chip Combo + Ferlock Set. You can only choose between the two, Sky Blow with fast Movement Speed with the ability to use Grudge Card, or Knuckle Arrow with Body Relocation with SP drain from multiple gears. For Knuckle Arrow build to work best, you need to stack on ASPD so that you body relocate really fast.
&lt;br>
:'''Gonryun Dungeon 1'''
::What to farm:
:::{{Item List |id=526 |item=Royal Jelly |simple=yes}}
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2336 |skill=Knuckle Arrow |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} or Auto-Attack with 193 ASPD and {{Skill List |id=272 |skill=Chain Combo |simple=yes}}
::Gears to use:
:::{{Item List |id=4606 | item=Grudge of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} , {{Item List |id=4605 | item=Agony of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} , Fire Element Weapon.
&lt;br>
:'''Sara's Memories'''
::What to farm:
:::Everything. Sell the +6 - +7 foods in the market to earn extra money.
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} you do not have to kill the final boss, you can just return to town after clearing all monsters.
::Gears to use:
:::{{Item List |id=4606 | item=Grudge of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=4605 | item=Agony of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}}
&lt;br>
:'''Ghost Palace'''
::What to farm:
:::{{Item List |id=6672 |item=Gray Shard |simple=yes}} you need this to get Thanatos weapons and {{Item List |id=27184 |item=Knight Sakray Card |simple=yes}}
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} to clean the Ghost Monsters that spawn on the second room. Lure everyone before using Rampage Blaster.
::Gears to use:
:::{{Item List |id=4606 | item=Grudge of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=4605 | item=Agony of Royal Knight Card | simple=yes}} with Fire/Holy Element Weapon.
&lt;br>
:'''Rachel Field 1'''
::What to farm:
::: {{Monster List |id=1106 |name=Desert Wolf |simple=yes}} which drop {{Item List |id=1253 |item=Katar |simple=yes}} , {{Item List |id=28075 |item=Crimson Dagger |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=6252 |item=Blood of Wolf |simple=yes}}
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} 
::Gears to use:
::: {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=1836 |item=Thanatos Knuckle |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::You can sell the Daggers and Katars to the Tool NPC and sell the Blood of Wolf to the player shops. Type @wb blood of wolf and sell your loots to their shop.
&lt;br>

====High Level Monsters====
&lt;br>
:'''Abyss Lake 3'''
::What to farm:
:::{{Item List |id=7938 |item=Light Granule |simple=yes}} sell these in the market not to the NPC. The rest of the loots can be sold to the NPC.
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=2346 |skill=Gentle Touch - Energy Gain |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} with {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}}.
::Gears to use:
:::Rideword Hat, Thanatos Hammer (Neutral Element), Hunter Fly, Phen Card, Thorny Buckler Combo, Sky Petite Card, the rest are ATK increasing gears. Your goal is that your Rampage Blaster damage must reach at least 60k without sacrificing your leeching gears. The stat build will be the same as the Tiger Cannon Combo stats which will be found in the Stat Build section. 
&lt;br>
:'''Basilisk Nest 3'''
::What to farm:
:::{{Item List |id=12573 |item=Fruit Basket |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=607 |item=Yggdrasil Berry |simple=yes}}, and {{Item List |id=608 |item=Yggdrasil Seed |simple=yes}}. You can obtain most of the Yggdrasil from opening the fruit basket. Also, {{Item List |id=11520 |item=Mora Mandarin |simple=yes}} sells for a good price when sold to the NPC.
::Skills to use:
:::{{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} and Tiger Cannon Combo. Also all of the essential skills for a Sura to farm. Tiger Cannon Combo will be your main killing skill and Flash Combo will be for cleaning remaining monsters.
::Gears to use:
:::Basically the same with the gears on Abyss Lake 3 but, you can either go for a Fire Element Crimson Weapon with Hunter Fly and White Knight or Thanatos Hammer with White Knight Card. Mad Bunny with Khalitzburg Knight Card for the shield and HP increasing cards/effects for the accessories. Armor and Garment is the same with COMBO SURA in the Gear Examples section.
&lt;br>
:'''Rudus Dungeon (Cor Core Hunting)'''
:Minimum Equipment Composition
::&lt;insert gears here>
:Skills Build Recommended
::I recommend using a Tiger Cannon build which utilizes HP/SP leeching for sustainability.
:::If you cannot 1 shot the monsters after luring, use {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earthshaker |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} as initiating skill and filler skill.
:::Lure enemies > cast {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earthshaker |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} this would be the ideal way if you are able to 1 shot the enemies with a much more expensive gear. However, with a limited budget we could still reach this goal but in a more tedious way which is using the combo {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}}.
::For the status point distribution, I recommend having:
:::Str +120
:::Agi +100
:::Vit +120 - 130
:::Int +70
:::Dex +100
:::Luk +0 
::Since you will probably be using a combo {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} to 1 shot the enemies you will need fast skill animation which needs high amounts of AGI and DEX.
:Monsters to look out for are:

| Passive
*Increases Flee up to a max of +15
|Important to max out, you need time to cast a combo on 10-20 mobs that deal 2.5k - 3k per hit. You need all the allowable time you can to burst your AoE skills before getting overwhelmed by the number of mobs attacking. While luring the mobs you will be hit with a couple of attacks and these attacks have a chance of being evaded due to your FLEE, but as the number of attacks increase the chance of evading decreases. To explain more specifically, once you lure a mob 10 monsters there is a small window of time you get once you stop moving before all the attacks of the 10 monsters hit you. Use this window to burst out your AoE skill before your Flee/Dodge stat disappears and take in tremendous damage. Without Flee/Dodge you will only depend on your shear defense and HP pool.

| {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}}
|Damage Skill / Combo Skill
*Castable
*Instant cast when used after Fallen Empire
*Damage dependent on ATK and HP missing
*Consumes SP in percent (%) form.
Shoots 7 spheres per strike. Will consume % of your SP thus reducing your SP pool to 300 makes this viable for PVE. Reducing SP to 100 or below is going to do more harm than good. One, you will not be able to cast Rising Dragon when SP pool goes below 100. Two, you will be sacrificing a lot of ATK from gears to be able to achieve this. Although, using this setup will greatly reduce the amount of SP potions you are going to use. I only recommend to get this setup against Tanky MvPs' that would take 12 people to kill. (Use Red Lantern to swap between you accessories after casting Rising Dragon to attain a closer result to 100 SP.) If you have more questions feel free to ask me directly.

Using the Tiger Cannon skill makes you deal a ton of damage. But doing the entire combo will give you twice the damage.&lt;br>

'''IMPORTANT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND:'''
*{{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} Damage Formula
::Damage is based on the following formula;
:::Damage (ATK) = [Base_Damage × (BaseLevel ÷ 100)]% + Bonus_Damage + Target_BaseLevel × 40
::Base Damage is determined with the following formula;
:::Normal = (HPamount_Result + SPamount_Result) ÷ 4
:::Combo = (HPamount_Result + SPamount_Result) ÷ 2
*’’’AGI and DEX’’’ will increase animation of your combos or more precisely it will increase the timing of your button presses thus making it faster.
::Formula;
:::Animation/Timing = 1.3 - (AGI x 0.004) - (DEX x 0.002)
'''Note:''' Take this with a grain of salt since I am not sure whether Nova uses this formula but, I am pretty sure that increasing AGI and DEX improves the speed in which you cast your skills. You may try this at training dummies.
*{{Skill List |id=2346 |skill=Gentle Touch - Energy Gain |simple=yes}} new effects and skill buffs.
::Increases {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} damage by 30% while under this skills buff.
*{{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} cool-down is reduced by 1 when combined with these gears.
::{{Item List |id=1846 |item=Illusion Combo Battle Glove |slots=2 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=20838 |item=Illusion Muffler |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::If both combined levels reach +18 the cool-down of {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} is reduced by 1. Thus you are able to cast the skill again after the first animation ended, simply removing downtime.

:+1% HP per 2 refines, best used with a high upgrade equipment.

:+4 STR +12 ATK -4 INT. Really nice for increasing ATK and lowering SP pool.
*{{Item List|id=4919 |item=Essence of Evil VIT 3}}

:Uninterrupted skill casting.
|You can mix and match these equipment to whichever is cheaper. For starters, from levels 100 - 140 it is better to stock up on ATK since your main damage dealing skill will be {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earth Shaker |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Blow |simple=yes}} which scales on your ATK. Obtaining {{Item List2 |id=15379 |item=Lava Leather Suit |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor-A |slots=1 |simple=yes}} boosts your ATK by a lot. This item is really cheap in the market which is a really good item to buy first in terms of priority.&lt;br>
In terms of weapon choice, I suggest picking {{Item List |id=1839 |item=Crimson Knuckle (Fire) |slots=2 |simple=yes}} for levels 100 - 130 since you will be farming monsters that are weak to Holy and Fire. You will most certainly be using Champion Combos at these levels so using Knuckle type weapons are the better option for better Attack-Speed.&lt;br>
The skills you will regularly use will be {{Skill List |id=272 |skill=Chain Combo |simple=yes}} , {{Skill List |id=273 |skill=Combo Finish |simple=yes}} ,  {{Skill List |id=372 |skill=Chain Crush Combo |simple=yes}} , {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}} , {{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon |simple=yes}} , {{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation |simple=yes}}
&lt;br>
For levels 130 - 150, I suggest picking between {{Item List |id=16040 |item=Crimson Mace (Water) |slots=2 |simple=yes}},{{Item List |id=1839 |item=Crimson Knuckle (Water) |slots=2 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=16028 |item=Thanatos Mace |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, or {{Item List |id=1836 |item=Thanatos Knuckle |slots=1 |simple=yes}} since at this level it is best to farm Magma Dungeon 2 and you get access to {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earth Shaker |simple=yes}}.
&lt;br>
General idea is to balance between HP and ATK and for which items are within your budget.
&lt;br>
A gear with:&lt;br>
*{{Item List |id=2383 |item=+ 0 Illusion Armor-A |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List2 |id=2507 |item=+ 0 Illusion Engine Wing-A |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List |id=2319 |item=Lava Leather Suit |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List |id=15128 |item=Excelion Suit (Atk) |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
These gears would give a good boost in ATK and would increase the effectiveness of a build which uses skills that mainly scales on ATK like {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earth Shaker |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}}.
Now pairing a good weapon to it would depend on what you specifically need, do you need sustainability? or more damage? If {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earth Shaker |simple=yes}} cannot one-hit-K.O. the mobs then I suggest choosing a weapon which gives more ATK and has the counter element to the monsters you are killing.
A gear with:&lt;br>
*{{Item List |id=2394 |item=Glorious Suit |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List |id=15116 |item=Armor of Airship |slots=1 |simple=yes}} set
*{{Item List |id=15091 |item=Gray Robe |slots=1 |simple=yes}} set
*{{Item List |id=20717 |item=Giant Snake Skin (Vit) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
With gears like these that mainly increase HP, then it would be best to focus on a build which uses {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} since these skills scales good on HP.&lt;br>
A good weapon to pair with these armors/set is either are {{Item List |id=16028 |item=Thanatos Mace |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=1839 |item=Crimson Knuckle |slots=2 |simple=yes}} since these weapons already have high weapon Atk at zero (0) refine.&lt;br>
If you wish to improve overall damage output then the priority in gear stats to achieve will be ATK > Vit > HP.&lt;br>
'''Note''':I suggest choosing HP focused builds on levels 160+ with the availability of maxed out core skills.

From levels 1 - 85.
These gears are obtained when reaching levels 50 - 59.
[[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#List_of_Eden_Group_Weapons Eden Group]]
*Headgear:  none
*Armor:     {{Item List |id=15011 |item=Eden Armor III |simple=yes}}
*Garment:   {{Item List |id=2560 |item=Eden Manteau |simple=yes}}
*Boots:     {{Item List |id=2458 |item=Eden Boots III |simple=yes}}
*Weapon:    {{Item List |id=16005 |item=Eden Mace II |simple=yes}}
These gears are really good and these greatly improve your survivability during the leveling process.
|
From levels 100+. I suggest these build to maximize your damage potential in Gonryun Dungeon 1F.
*Headgear:  {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*Armor:     {{Item List |id=15011 |item=Eden Armor III |simple=yes}}
*Garment:   {{Item List |id=20717 |item=Giant Snake Skin (STR) |simple=yes}}
*Boots:     {{Item List |id=2458 |item=Eden Boots III |simple=yes}}
*Weapon:    {{Item List |id=1839 |item=Crimson Knuckle (Fire) |simple=yes}}
I do not recommend using shield at this point since wearing shields decreases your ASPD by a lot and that decreases your chances of activating Chain Combos.
|
From levels 130+. Building gears that increases STR and ATK is essential to increase your damage potential in Gramps Quests. The skills you will be using will be {{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon |simple=yes}},{{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earth Shaker |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2347 |skill=Gentle Touch - Change |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2346 |skill=Gentle Touch - Energy Gain |simple=yes}}.
*Headgear:  {{Item List |id=18997 |item=Runaway Chip |simple=yes}}
*Armor:     {{Item List2 |id=15376 |item=Illusion Armor-A |simple=yes}}
*Garment:   {{Item List2 |id=20933 |item=Illusion Engine Wing-A |simple=yes}}
*Boots:     {{Item List |id=22007 |item=Temporal Boots of Str |simple=yes}}
*Weapon:    {{Item List |id=16028 |item=Thanatos Mace |simple=yes}}
*Shield:    {{Item List |id=2124 |item=Thorny Buckler |simple=yes}}
*Accessory: {{Item List |id=28326 |item=Broken Chip 1  |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*Accessory: {{Item List |id=28327 |item=Broken Chip 2 |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
If you cannot afford Illusion Armors then I suggest buying the Lava Armors.&lt;br>
If you do not have access to White Knight and Khalitzburg Knight Card Combo I suggest using {{Item List |id=2122 |item=Platinum Shield |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
|
From levels 160+. When you get access to Rising Dragon, Tiger Cannon and Flash Combo then I suggest building up HP,SP, and STR.
*Headgear:  {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*Armor:     {{Item List |id=2394 |item=Glorious Suit |simple=yes}}
*Garment:   {{Item List |id=20717 |item=Giant Snake Skin (Vit) |simple=yes}}

*Accessory: {{Item List |id=2722 |item=Medal of Honor (Acolyte) |simple=yes}}
'''Note:'''Wakwak Card goes with Temp Str Boots and Jejeling Card goes with Temp Vit Boots. Either you get 120 STR or 120 VIT. Whichever of the two is fine.

'''Notes'''
:General rule to follow when balancing gears for builds that primarily use Tiger Cannon only are:
::When your ATK is below 600 - 500 then it is better to build gears that increases VIT, HP, and SP rather than gears with stats like Atk +%.
::For builds that uses weapons +4 - +9, I suggest using Illusion Armor-A or Vit Soutane.
:::Which is better between a +9 Illusion Armor-A and +9 Vit Soutane?
::::I would lean more on a +9 Illusion Armor-A if your budget is limited since this armor is versatile with other Sura builds.
:::But does +9 Vit Soutane give more damage?
::::Yes Vit Soutane does give more damage but not a lot. Also, it will highly depend on the gears you are wearing. If you are wearing gears with Atk% and ATK value reaching 600+ then the difference in damage output between the two armors is very small. But when you wear gears that give HP%, and VIT+, then most likely you will notice the difference in damage.
&lt;br>
:General rule to follow when doing a build for a mixed combo Sura.
::You will need to lean more on ATK increasing gears so that {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} damage values will be balanced. In this type of build, you will most frequently use {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} thus the balance in gear combination will be complex. 
:::The sequence of the combo will be: {{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}}
::Increase the damage of {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} without decreasing much of {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} damage.
&lt;br>
:If you plan to use this build mainly for farming then I suggest a gear composition that is enough to clean the mob with 1 or 2 skills. Always wear HP/SP leeching gears to help sustain your farming run.
:If you plan on mainly dealing damage, then I suggest using {{Item List2 |id=32170 |item=Mega Rejuvenation Potion |simple=yes}} and {{Item List2 |id=32166 |item=Mega Potion of Energy |simple=yes}} to help boost survivability.

Although this is no longer the common build for Tiger Cannon, with this build you are still able to dish almost equal with the illusion gears with the freedom of choosing a better Garment to use.

This build can either be focused more on combo GoH or pure Tiger Cannon. Whichever you prefer is solely up to you.

This build is mainly for increasing Tiger Cannon Damage.

This does not represent the BEST gear composition since I do not have all the resources I need to test. This build is from my personal experience only so if you ever think something is much better to use then by all means.

:: For starting, use the skills Sky Net Blow and Earthshaker. (These will be the priority in skill learning.) The stats to increase will be STR mostly. The equipment should be mainly ATK increasing. This is for levels 145+ below. For levels above 145+ then I suggest slowly integrating HP% and VIT increasing equipment to your set.
: Which is better? ATK or HP?
:: Ah the million dollar question.
•	Because of the new update we do not need to increase ATK or Atk% to cater to our filler skills such as {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}}, what this means is we can now fully use only {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} because there is no more downtime in the rotation of both skills.&lt;br>
•	Are you new to the Sura class? If you are, then an HP% build is more suited to you for more survivability and tankiness it gives more room for error.&lt;br>
•	Based on the equipment I have tested, ATK based build deal more damage than an HP focused one.&lt;br>
•	You can use a calculator to do a theoretical computation before committing to a set.&lt;br>
: Old Blazing Soul vs Illusion Hot Headed Headband (IHHB)?
:: This is also dependent on the circumstances, I would pick IHHB over Old Blazing Soul if the enemy is water, neutral, wind, earth element. I would pick Old Blazing Sould (Mettle) if I am using ATK focused equipment. I would prefer Old Blazing Soul (Adamantine) for tanking and HP focused build.&lt;br>
: Is Tiger Cannon a good all-around build? 
:: Yes.
: How much damage can I reach with my Tiger Cannon (combo)?
:: For a normal scenario with regular buffs, about 6m to 9m.
:: For a general scenario with public party and full buff around 13m – 17m.
:: If you run with friends and a highly specific team composition, around 20m – 30m or maybe even more.

{{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} build is a one of the cheapest builds to make that greatly improves your overall damage output but, I could only recommend going through this route when you are at maximum level.
Pros and Cons of a {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} build are:&lt;br>
'''Pro'''
*Ranged Physical Damage - having a skill that could deal ranged damage greatly adds to the versatility of a class since a lot of the monsters and Boss monsters are equipped with anti-melee mechanics such as {{Skill List |id=2311|skill=Reflect Damage |simple=yes}}.
*Staggered Damage - a great thing about staggered damage is that it increases the chances of activating skills/effects that require a certain percentage(%) of attacks to the monster. Example: Hawk Eye effect from Temporal Boots and {{Skill List |id=2346 |skill=Gentle Touch - Energy Gain |simple=yes}}.
*After Cast Delay - after-cast delay is the animation in which you are paused before another skill is casted, the best way to properly show this behavior is using lvl 1 GoH and lvl 10 GoH. One of the good sides of this skill is that it is usable even without reaching the Max ACD, it slow in terms of animation but still it is far better in terms of playability compared to Knuckle Arrow Build. 
'''Con'''
*Downtime - one of the downside of Gates of Hell is that you would need spheres as ammunition and it is limited to 15 and you would need to reload your spheres to continue dealing damage. When compared to other hold down button attacks such as Knuckle Arrow, GoH would certainly lose in terms of Damage per Second.
*Cast-Time - this status is the main reason why Gates of Hell build is highly reliant on DEX and INT and it is centered upon these stats thus choosing gears that would also complement. In order to instant-cast the skill without needing to wait for a timed animation, you would need to reach a total of 540 from your combined (2xDEX) + INT. 

Gates of Hell used to be limited to 3 - 5 uses due to the amount of spheres it requires, which you would need to use Dangerous Soul Collect to refresh your sphere supply. With the new improvement of the skill, Gates of Hell could be used 7 - 9 times but at the cost of removing the melee behavior of the skill at lower levels.&lt;br>
'''IMPORTANT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND'''
*{{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} Damage Forumula
:Damage is based on the following formula;
::Damage (ATK) = [Base_Damage × (BaseLevel ÷ 100)]% + Bonus_Damage
:::Lv 1] : 500% ATK, 800% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 2] : 1000% ATK, 1600% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 3] : 1500% ATK, 2400% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 4] : 2000% ATK, 3200% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 5] : 2500% ATK, 4000% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 6] : 3000% ATK, 4800% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 7] : 3500% ATK, 5600% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 8] : 4000% ATK, 6400% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv 9] : 4500% ATK, 7200% ATK (If used in combo).
:::[Lv10] : 5000% ATK, 8000% ATK (If used in combo).
:The bonus damage is increased based on the casters Base Level, Max HP and Current HP, and Max SP and Current SP.
:Bonus damage is calculated base on the following formula;
::Normal = (User_MaxHP − User_HP) + (User_SP × SP_Modifier) + (BaseLevel × 10)
::Combo = (User_MaxHP − User_HP) + (User_MaxSP × SP_Modifier) + (BaseLevel × 40)
:::[Lv 1] : x1.2 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 2] : x1.4 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 3] : x1.6 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 4] : x1.8 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 5] : x2.0 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 6] : x2.2 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 7] : x2.4 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 8] : x2.6 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv 9] : x2.8 SP Modifier.
:::[Lv10] : x3.0 SP Modifier.

*This skills damage is increased if it is used in a combo.
*This skill is always considered a long ranged attack on all skill levels.

&lt;br>
:For the status point distribution, I went full 130 DEX to help obtain 100% Virtual Cast-Time because the bonuses of the equipment that are available to you will most likely be insufficient.
:I went with 80 LUK because the stat gives damage, and when you reach 100 LUK you will gain Curse Immunity which is very handy. You will be able to reach 100 LUK with the help of Food Buffs and Extra Stats from your Class Shadow Set.
:If you want to use this build for farming, then I suggest ditching the LUK and placing the stats on STR for more weight, AGI for more ASPD which helps in animation and VIT for survivability and bonus damage.

I highly suggest to go with this build when reaching Max level since achieving instant cast is really hard. Even with your character reaching max level, you will still need to use Status Foods [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Sara%27s_Memory Sara Memory] to get an extra boost.&lt;br>
Assuming you are new to the game with a very low budget, I highly recommend farming zeny first since the build is quite expensive.&lt;br>
An example (affordable) gear composition would be:&lt;br>
*{{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Essence DEX 3)
*{{Item List |id=18874 |item=Monocle |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Essence DEX 3)
*{{Item List |id=19268 |item=Poison Breath |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List2 |id=15400 |item=+6 Dex Soutane |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List |id=20717 |item=Giant Snake Skin (14DEX) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}(Menblatt)
*{{Item List |id=22010 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity (EA)(BM) |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Essence DEX 3)
*{{Item List |id=16040 |item=+7 - +15 Crimson Mace |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List2 |id=42207 |item=Illusion Booster-R (EA)(ASPD4)(DRAIN) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
*{{Item List2 |id=42208 |item=Illusion Booster-L (EA)(DEX3)(DEX3) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
:This build is with 130 Dex and 110 Int with +5 Dex and Int Food and Blessing Buff. With this build you sacrifice damage over instant cast GoH which is really difficult to reach with affordable gears.
:From this example,it is far better to go with Tiger Cannon Build instead if you are really limited with budget. With Tiger Cannon you could deal far better damage output and would have better gear prgoression.
&lt;br>
Now addressing the issue of SP consumption of {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}}, there is no easy solution to this. However I could show you some ways you could counter this dilemma.
*{{Skill List |id=2340 |skill=Power Absorb}} is your main SP recovering skill through your entire life as a Sura. You must get used to keep on using this skill during fights and after fights.
::The most efficient way of using this skill is by increasing your SP pool. The larger the SP the larger the SP you recover since this skill recovers SP in % form. Using {{Item List |id=12427 |item=SP Increase Potion (Large) |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=12436 |item=Vitata 500 |simple=yes}} greatly buffs {{Skill List |id=2340 |skill=Power Absorb |simple=yes}}  effects thus helping your recover faster.
*Leeching gears such as {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=16028 |item=Thanatos Mace |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List2 |id=42208 |item=Illusion Booster-L (EA)(DEX3)(DEX3) |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=28510 |item=Vampire's Familliar |slots=1 |simple=yes}}.
*Leeching pet such as {{Item List |id=9052 |item=Incubus Pet |simple=yes}}
*Using SP Potion such as {{Item List |id=11520 |item=Mora Mandarin |simple=yes}} and {{Item List2 |id=34158 |item=Concentrated Blue Potion |simple=yes}} 
*SP Rgenerating Potion such as {{Item List2 |id=32164 |item=Potion of Energy |simple=yes}} , {{Item List2 |id=32166 |item=Mega Potion of Energy |simple=yes}}, and {{Item List |id=32705 |item=Gin Potion of Energy |simple=yes}}

In this build, the obtaining the Illusion Armor and Good Temporal Boots are probably the most expensive items you are going to save-up for.&lt;br>
If you are not able to reach 540 total points for insta-cast, you will need to sacrifice damage cards for DEX essence.&lt;br>
Also you will be needing to use {{Item List |id=12432 |item=Siroma Icetea}} and {{Item List |id=12430 |item=Warg Blood Cocktail}} which are quite expensive.
I chose {{Item List |id=16040 |item=Crimson Mace |slots=2 |simple=yes}} since most of the monster you are going to be killing are of Medium and Large sizes. Choosing knuckle would give you better ASPD and less animation but you would also lose 25% damage on large Boss.

For this next build, I highly suggest obtaining the headgear first with the enchants so that you could use damage increasing cards without sacrificing Cast-Time. &lt;br>
Do not sell your {{Item List |id=19296 |item=+7 Fancy Feather Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} since you will need it on Garranth/Garronath.&lt;br>
With this build, you will not be reliant on {{Item List |id=12432 |item=Siroma Icetea}} and {{Item List |id=12430 |item=Warg Blood Cocktail}} since the headgear adds so much DEX stat thus making the build a much reliable and sustainable build. In some circumstances where you need to adjust your stat build for some reason, you may need to use these potions again.&lt;br>

The choice of gear composition will soley rely upon which you prefer, '''High Damage with Delay in Skill''' or '''Medium Damage with a Better Delay in Skill''' &lt;br>

With DEX enchanted Str Soutane you can play around more with the build, you get access to strong Garments that boosts your Range Damage by a lot but at the cost of having low After-Cast Delay.&lt;br>
You could also go with garments that increase both ATK and ACD(After-cast Delay) which is the {{Item List |id=20749 |item=+9 Fallen Warrior Manteau |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. I suggest getting these for solo hunting/instancing builds without the help of Minstrel Class but for the purpose of doing Monster Hunter content I do not suggest buying these since they are really expensive.&lt;br>

{{Skill List |id=2336 |skill=Knuckle Arrow |simple=yes}} is an amazing skill in the right circumstances. This skill shines in Monster Hunter and Bio5? (I have not fully tested the skill with the best gear combination yet for bio5). What makes this skill great is that it does not need for you to adjust your status build for it to have Instant Cast since it does not need one. You are free to maximize your damage output with your stats however, this skill's greatest weakness is the high amount of ACD(After-Cast Delay) it requires to be able to properly use it.&lt;br>

Leap towards a target and strike it with long ranged physical damage, knocking back the target in the process. If the target is knocked into a wall or obstacle, they will take additional damage.&lt;br>

This skill deals increased damage to Boss monsters, since they can not be knocked back.&lt;br>
This skills damage is increased based on the casters Base Level.&lt;br>

*[Lv 1] : 600% ATK, +750% ATK (If knocked into wall), 700% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 2] : 700% ATK, +300% ATK (If knocked into wall), 900% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 3] : 800% ATK, +450% ATK (If knocked into wall), 1100% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 4] : 900% ATK, +600% ATK (If knocked into wall), 1300% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 5] : 1000% ATK, +750% ATK (If knocked into wall), 1500% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 6] : 1100% ATK, +900% ATK (If knocked into wall), 1700% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 7] : 1200% ATK, +1050% ATK (If knocked into wall), 1900% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 8] : 1300% ATK, +1200% ATK (If knocked into wall), 2100% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv 9] : 1400% ATK, +1350% ATK (If knocked into wall), 2300% ATK (Against Boss monster).
*[Lv10] : 1500% ATK, +1500% ATK (If knocked into wall), 2500% ATK (Against Boss monster).

Damage is based on the following formula;&lt;br>
Damage (ATK) = [Base_Damage × (BaseLevel ÷ 100)]%&lt;br>

Knockback damage is based on this formula;&lt;br>
Added Damage (ATK) = [Knockback_Damage + (1000 × Target_CurrWeight ÷ Target_WeightLimit) + (Target_BaseLevel × 5) × (BaseLevel ÷ 150)]%&lt;br>

'''Pro'''
*Skill damage is not forced neutral, thus making this a viable build for Bio5.
*Great damage output when used with the right equipment.
*Easy to use.

'''Con'''
*Limited weapon choices. Highly dependent on {{Item List |id=1866 |item=Dedicated Bandage(Chen Memory) |slots=2 |simple=yes}} for best damage output.
*High ACD(After-Cast Delay) requirement.
&lt;br>

Based on the skill description itself, a build focusing on this skill is not meant for low levels. I highly suggest going through this route when you have properly established your character, what I mean is that you have separate builds for farming and instancing which you can fallback to.&lt;br>
If you want to build a Sura entirely just for Monster Hunter content and assuming you have high amounts of Zeny then yes go for it.&lt;br>
If you are a newbie and you are enchanted by this build because it is popular, then I strongly suggest to stay away from it.&lt;br>
:1. The build is expensive and it does not do well with mediocre gears, it will probably take a couple of months to farm the weapon alone '''or''' a couple of hours if you find the server good and plan to '''SUPPORT''' it and sell Nova Points which I also highly suggest you do too ;-). (Simp!)
:2. Knuckle Arrow build is not the only Sura build which you could use to do (finish) Monster Hunter content.&lt;br>

Although there are some fun things you could do with this Skill.&lt;br>
*Great skill for farming {{Item List |id=756 |item=Rough Oridecon |simple=yes}} in combination with {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}} at Dewata Dungeon 2.
*A good alternative build for farming Geffenia if you do not get disoriented with the skill animation.
&lt;br>
{{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} is a good AoE skill since it is really easy to use and all the monster around you get hit. Rampgae Blaster is a skill made to be used as a burst type of skill since it requires you to use Earthshaker to have the maximum damage output.&lt;br>
Is it good? If you focus mainly on Rampage Blaster damage you may reach a somewhat good amount of damage able to farm Einbroch 3 Dungeon. But, is it better than Tiger Cannon? No it is not better than Tiger Cannon.&lt;br>
This skill is best paired with Knuckle Arrow since it synergies well in terms of gears and stats.

When using this build outside Monster Hunter, the demand for better gears and equipment synergies increases since you do not get bonus After-Cast Delay.&lt;br>
Knuckle Arrow build shines most when using multiple gears (swapping) and when used with Rampage Blaster.&lt;br>
You have the option to have a build focused on {{Skill List |id=2336 |skill=Knuckle Arrow |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} as the secondary damage skill or the other way around.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
For a build focused on {{Skill List |id=2336 |skill=Knuckle Arrow |simple=yes}} you would need to focus your gear composition on After-Cast Delay. Take into consideration whether you will be doing solo content or be in a party with a Minstrel.&lt;br>

When outside Monster Hunter, you will need to change your Headgear and Garment to those that give After-Cast Delay. You might also need to change your Shadow Gears to Reload and Penetration just to get that extra ACD.&lt;br>

There are four (4) builds I have tried in Monster Hunter and these builds will be ranked from cheapest to expensive.&lt;br>
As starting players, I urge you to not depend on other players when starting this content. What I mean by this is when you need to do Nyia/Garranth and you don't find people recruiting on the airship, I strongly suggest you make the party and invite other players. With this in mind, DO NOT BE PICKY with the people who will be joining you, invite all those who are with no experience as you and you should all train together. Keep on repeating the instance until all of you learn the mechanics, there is no easy way in Monster Hunter.&lt;br>
With that said, there is a certain gear level you need to be in before doing Monster Hunter content. You cannot just do Monster Hunter with Eden Equipment since you will be the reason the team fails.&lt;br>
In this guide, I will show you the minimum gear you will need to be able to do Monster Hunter effectively as a Sura.&lt;br>

===='''Gates of Hell (Utility)'''====
Gates of Hell is one of the best skill to use to make a really cheap build since the gears available are cheap and affordable. The range is great and the damage is good. A Gates of Hell build will need you to have DEX and INT as main stats for Variable Cast-Time and Range Attack requirements, with that in mind having a build with DEX and INT synergies very well with the Utility role since the Bombring damage scales with the aforementioned stats also.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
The items I have provided are the minimum gears you will need to be able to achieve this build. Using any gears with lesser effects than the ones provided will not guarantee the effectiveness of the build.&lt;br>

This build is the cheapest option which gives you the best output as a Utility in a party.&lt;br>
You will need to use potions to increase your stats to be able to insta-cast your Gates of Hell.&lt;br>
Always bring these items:&lt;br>
:{{Item List2 |id=32043 |item=Mega Warg Blood Cocktail 30m |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List2 |id=32044 |item=Mega Minor Brisket 30m |simple=yes}}

:{{Item List2 |id=32074 |item=Int Tonic |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List2 |id=29901 |item=Dash Juice |simple=yes}}
Lastly, always bring Sarah Memories Foods.
:{{Item List |id=12091 |item=Peach Cake |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=12076 |item=Red Mushroom Wine |simple=yes}}
When playing as Utiliy, always keep in mind to always be prepared to use Stun Poring whenever Nysori is about to use the Two Crystals.&lt;br>
Always position yourself near the Healer or the DPS so that whenever they are charmed it is faster for you to release them. Always keep in mind the cool-down of the Bombring so that you can use it on the Charm.&lt;br>
Do not spam the Bombring mindlessly thinking you will outdps other classes which you will not.&lt;br>
Be a team-player and always reserve your Bombring stacks for when Nysori is about to use the Two-Crystal move.&lt;br>
Always be mindful with the party, if you think your DPS is really strong then that means there is less time to build your stacks so make it a priority to build the stacks than to hit Nysori. If you think your DPS is slow, then you can spam Bomb Rings and Stun Porings to get Megatron Stack.&lt;br>
Lastly, to further help your tank please keep a stack for Sleep Poring whenever Nysori does the cage. Inform your Tank that you will cast Sleep Poring during Cage so that your Tank knows where and when to move.&lt;br>

'''I would like to update this build as to the current changes in Monster Hunter, doing Tiger Cannon Utility build will most likely make it very difficult for your party to have a smooth run since you will most likely always steal the aggro from the tank because of the amount of damage that you will deal. So Tiger Cannon builds will now be best best used in a Damage role.'''&lt;br>


This build is my favorite since it not only does good damage but also gives great survivability.&lt;br>
For this build, I only use Flash Combo and Tiger Cannon combo to maximize the rotation of my skills and minimize confusion. To be able to adapt faster to this build, I suggest to make your build as simple as possible and when you are comfortable with your setup you may then combine other skills or potions to increase your output.&lt;br>
:When you get used to the standard skill rotation then you may use {{Item List |id=12030 |item=Box of Resentment |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=606 |item=Aloevera |simple=yes}}&lt;br>

'''Notice''': You will most likely take the aggro if you are on Utility Role so be careful.&lt;br>
Standard Skill rotation will be:&lt;br>
:{{MH Skill|id=100003|skill=Battle Trance}} > {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} > Repeat &lt;br>
&lt;br>
For Utility Role, my Skill Rotation will be:&lt;br>
:Bombring > {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon Combo |simple=yes}} > Repeat&lt;br>

Why not use {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} with the combo?&lt;br>
:The gear synergy with Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell is not that good.
:You will deal more damage with Tiger Cannon and Flash Combo.
:Using Gates of Hell in the combo adds more mechanical stress on your brain it adds to more chances of you doing errors thus lowering your potential.
::What I mean by this is you will most likely fail some of the timings of your combo thus affecting your skill rotation. The simpler the better.

'''SKILL BUILD'''
&lt;br>
The skill build is still the same as with Tiger Cannon Build with Flash Combo. &lt;br>
Take note that {{Skill List |id=2328 |skill=Earthshaker |simple=yes}} increases your melee damage against Great Monsters by 5% which is quite a significant buff.&lt;br>

This build is an example composition which I am currently using, you may have better output than me when you experiment with different gears.&lt;br>
But still keep in mind, no amount of gear will lead you to success if you do not master the mechanics of Monster Hunter.&lt;br>
Also a bit of advice, you will most likely keep on missing your combo sequences during Monster Hunter because of the amount of status buffs you will be receiving, a much different scenario from your usual dungeon buffs. What this means is you will have much more AGI and DEX in your build which quickens the timings of your combos. To adjust to this change, you will have to press faster than your normal combo rythm.&lt;br>
You can replicate this by going to the training dummies and reset your skills to AGI + 130 and DEX + 130 and try to feel the difference in speed of your combos.&lt;br>
Place a Tiger Cannon skill on a skill slot which you can easily see for you to know when Tiger Cannon finishes cooldown.&lt;br>

&lt;br>
{| class="wikitable" style=" width: 100%" | TANK BUILD
|-
|
In this current update of Monster Hunter which you can look [[https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/news/mh-hate-patch-notes-156-r333/| here]]&lt;br>
With the new changes to hate generation, the typical Tank no longer works wherein a class filled with HP and VIT cannot generate hate unless the tank deals a significant amount of damage which should also be in relation to the damage dealt by the Damage Role class. I know it is quite confusing. To make it simple if A(Damager) deals 1 damage then B(Tank) should deal 1/7 amount of damage to generate hate and keep aggro on tank.&lt;br>
Yes this would mean Tank should be very geared in order to keep aggro to himself when partied with high DPS classes.&lt;br>
I will just keep it simple here since most of the equipments is the same.
&lt;br>
'''Things to consider:'''
:-This will never guarantee a 100% effective way of tanking since the new mechanics of tanking is dependent on the tank's damage. This means the tank must build a very damage focused equipment composition to even get a stable hate generation.
:-There is a limit to how much damage we can do since Tiger Cannon and Flash Combo rotation is still not a consistent form of DPS. Even if we deal 10 million Tiger Cannon, this will not equate to 10million DPS. This rotation of skills will still have a downtime after a couple of casts. After your first round of rotation you will notice a small millisecond of nothingness since both Flash Combo and Tiger Cannon will be on cooldown and also after your 3rd or 4th rotation of skills you will have to refresh your Spirit Spheres and this in itself is also a problem.
:-When tanking, it will be difficult to use Dangerous Soul Collect since we will not be protected against interruption unless we use a Phen Card which also in turn reduces our overall damage. The only way to recover Spirit Spheres in this situation would be to spam Dragon Combo to activate Gentle Touch Energy Gain or get lucky somehow to be able to cast Dangerous Soul Collect.
:-In this current state of MH, it is best to avoid going through Tank role unless you are with friends since playing with public parties will just make everything worse. Not all players are teamwork oriented, most people are aiming for the shortest completion time and not for the completion itself.
&lt;br>

'''SKILL BUILD'''
:Skills build is similar with Tiger Cannon Build, but with Steel Body at max level.
&lt;br>
'''EQUIPMENT'''
::{{Item List |id=5754 |item=Blazing Soul (Adamantine 5) |slots=1 |simple=yes}} - For Garronath
::{{Item List |id=19344 |item=Illusion Hot Blooded Headband (Pow or Stam) |slots=1 |simple=yes}} - For Nysori
::{{Item List2 |id=32879 |item=Magical Booster (Atk%) |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=2608 |item=Rosary in Mouth |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List2 |id=450127 |item=+11 Automatic Armor-A (TC)(TC)(Pow) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=1846 |item=+15 Illusion Combo Battle Glove |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=20838 |item=+11 Illusion Muffler (Stam) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=22006 |item=+9 Temporal Boots of Strength (FS)(Muscular Endurance) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=28946 |item=Purified Knight Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=28483 |item=Royal Guard Ring (Vit)(Atk%) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Item List |id=52228 |item=King Schmidt Strong Insignia (Strong) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
&lt;br>
If you are wondering why I am not using Vit Soutane, this is personal preference since I think Automatic Armor gives way better damage compare to Vit Soutane.&lt;br>
Here are some of the reasons behind a more ATK focused build.&lt;br>
* I am quite confident in my skills to adapt in certain situations that is why I am more inclined to ATK focused gears.
* Based on my experience, using Automatic Armor to tank is quite enough although a good Archbishop would make life easier.
* I aim to deal at least 10m damage on the luring fish to free the Damager or Healer from the lure since I do not rely on Climactic Fury that much.
If I am with a difficult party composition I would switch my headgear to Blazing Soul just to have more survivability.
&lt;br>
'''TIPS that are not TIPS'''
&lt;br>
I will never be able to teach you here on how to tank but what I can tell you is, (Experience is the best Teacher) so if you really want to learn fast, I suggest to keep on trying until you are confident in your skills.

|-

===='''BIO 5 TANK'''====
&lt;br>
I just want to keep things short since most of the gears are already mentioned.&lt;br>
'''The Tank Role Sura'''
So, there are two types of tank builds in for Sura in BIO 5.&lt;br>
:'''1.) The Steel Body Sura'''
:'''2.) The Body Relocation Sura'''
====For Option 1. (The Steel Body Sura)====
&lt;br>
Most of the things is quite simple to understand, just cast Steel Body and you're done. To me this is not the case. Our greatest hurdle in BIO 5 is {{Monster List |id=2237 |name=Celia |simple=yes}} because of that Dispell skill.&lt;br>
The moment we get Dispelled we lose our Steel Body which is the one that gives us the ability to tank the we get killed instantly.&lt;br>
I cannot guarantee that you will be able to join most public parties such as parties with (Guyak Farming Parties) since those people farm BIO5 with speed.
&lt;br>
This setup is catered more towards players with parties having little to no experience on BIO 5. I could suggest this as a very cheap build for tanking BIO 5.&lt;br>
{{Skill List |id=268 |skill=Steel Body |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
:This skill reduces all incoming attacks by 90%.
:We will have reduced movement speed and attack speed when activated.
:Requires 5 Spirit Spheres to Cast
:Variable Cast Time &amp; Fixed Cast Time is 2.5 secs
:Uninterruptible casting.
These are the problems we will face.&lt;br>
:1.) Dispell from Sorcerer Celia
:2.) We get our mana drained.
:3.) We lose our Critical State
:4.) We lose our Spirit Spheres
To counter some of the problems of this build, here are some solutions I have come up with.&lt;br>
:1.) Use {{Item List2 |id=34159 |item=Concentrated Gold Syrup |simple=yes}} to outpotion the incoming damage received when you are Dispelled or when the duration of Steel Body expires.
::1.1) From the solution above we will still have the problem of having no spheres left thus we would need to use {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}} but in order to successfully regenerate the spheres we would need to protect ourselves from interruption in which we would need {{Item List |id=4077 |item=Phen Card |simple=yes}}.
:2.) Since we will get our mana constantly drained, we will have to counter this by bringing SP Regenerating Potion. {{Item List2 |id=34158 |item=Concentrated Blue Syrup Potion  |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=533 |item=Grape Juice |simple=yes}}.
:3.) Use HP or DEF increasing equipment to minimize the damage received.
&lt;br>
For the gear choices:
&lt;br>
:{{Item List |id=18550 |item=Asgard Blessing |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=18979 |item=Old Blazing Soul |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=15095 |item=Hero Judgement Shoal |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List2 |id=15393 |item=Gold Dragon Plate |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4031 Pecopeco Card}}
:{{Item List |id=2394 |item=Glorious Suit |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=20743 |item=Airship Cloak |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4133 Raydric Card}}
:{{Item List |id=22010 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity (Muscular Endurance) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4381 Green Ferus}}
:{{Item List |id=2124 |item=Thorny Buckler |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4253 Alice Card}}
:{{Item List |id=2702 |item=Bison Horn |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4077 Phen Card}}
:{{Item List |id=2990 |item=Pendant of Harmony |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
&lt;br>
====For Option 2.====
&lt;br>
The Body Relocation Tank method is simply the tank running around taking the monsters' aggression then tanking their full damage via out-positioning the incoming attacks by the healing effects.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
My skill rotations are:&lt;br>
{{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation  |simple=yes}} (lure as much enemies as possible) > {{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation  |simple=yes}} (into the Land Protector to protect yourself from Earthquake) &lt;br>
or
{{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation  |simple=yes}} (lure as much enemies as possibe) > {{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation  |simple=yes}} (position yourself into a wall) > use as much {{Item List2 |id=34159 |item=Concentrated Gold Syrup |simple=yes}} until the your DPS players clean the monsters.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
The most frequent skill you will be using are {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect  |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=270 |skill=Critical Explosion  |simple=yes}} since you will be constantly getting dispelled and the only way to snap around continously would require you to be in the state of Fury.&lt;br>
Also, using {{Skill List |id=249 |skill=Auto Guard  |simple=yes}} from {{Item List2 |id=4572 |item=Randel Card |simple=yes}} is one good extra protection to have. Use this by swapping to a 2nd Garment.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
:'''Should I use {{Skill List |id=268 |skill=Steel Body |simple=yes}} in this build?'''
::Yes, you must use Steel Body when:
:::1.) When your party gets wiped out, immediately use {{Skill List |id=268 |skill=Steel Body |simple=yes}} and try to ressurrect as many members as you can with {{Item List |id=610 |item=Yggdrasil Leaf |simple=yes}}.
:::2.) When there are at least 15 - 20 monsters around, snap in and snap out near a wall then use Steel Body.
:::3.) Use it when you encounter an MvP.
:'''What level should my {{Skill List |id=268 |skill=Steel Body |simple=yes}} be?'''
::Only use level 3 of the skill so that incase you do not get Dispelled or Cleared the duration of the skill is low.
&lt;br>
For the gear choices:&lt;br>
These are based on my personal preference since I found this gear composition to be much more resilient to dying.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
:{{Item List |id=18979 |item=Old Blazing Soul (Adamantine 5) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4582 Bungisngis Card}}
:{{Item List |id=15128 |item=Excellion Suit (DEF,DEF,DEF) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=20773 |item=Excellion Wing (DEF,DEF,DEF) |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=22010 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity (Muscular Endurance) |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4381 Green Ferus}}
:{{Item List |id=2124 |item=Thorny Buckler |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4253 Alice Card}}
:{{Item List |id=2702 |item=Bison Horn |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
::{{Card |id=4077 Phen Card}}
:{{Item List |id=2990 |item=Pendant of Harmony |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List |id=1525 |item=Long Mace |slots=0 |simple=yes}}
&lt;br>
For the status points:
&lt;br>
:STR = 70 - 90
:AGI = 70 - 100
:VIT = 100
:INT = 100
:DEX = 120
:LUK = 100

&lt;br>

=='''''POTIONS &amp; FOODS'''''==
&lt;br>
'''MAIN HP HEALING ITEM''' 
:{{Item List2 |id=34159 |item=Concentrated Golden Syrup |simple=yes}}. This is the best healing potion in-game currently, High Healing Effectiveness and Low Weight value of 0.2 which makes it the best potion for emergency cases. Very easy to make too. Check this link for cooking requirements. ( https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Creation_Database#Potion_Creation_.28Pharmacy.29 )
:{{Item List2 |id=34159 |item=White Syrup |simple=yes}}. The second best healing item in-game which is also very accessible. This item can be bought from an NPC. Great for leveling which can only be used by players who are level 60+.

'''MAIN SP HEALING ITEM'''
:{{Item List2 |id=34158 |item=Concentrated Blue Syrup Potion |simple=yes}}. A very good alternative to healing great amounts of SP. Easy to manufacture but a bit expensive.
:{{Item List |id=533 |item=Grape Juice |simple=yes}}. This is still one of the best SP potion to use for starting players. Sold from Tool Dealer NPC.

'''Healing Over-Time Consumables''' 
:{{Item List2 |id=34301 |item=Mega Rejuvenation Potion 30m  |simple=yes}}
:{{Item List2 |id=34299|item=Mega Potion of Energy 30m |simple=yes}}
::These items restore HP and SP over-time for a certain amount of duration which makes them the best support consumables to use when farming, instance runs, and dungeons. Personally I only use these consumables on difficult instances or dungeons. (LOGH and Bio 5)
&lt;br>
As for the foods I use.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12424 |item=HP Increase Potion (Large) |simple=yes}} - Increase your maximum HP and also increases your Tiger Cannon damage.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12427 |item=SP Increase Potion (Large) |simple=yes}} - Increase your max SP which also slightly increases Tiger Cannon damage and greatly increases Asura damage. 
{{Item List |id=22544 |item=Awakening Potion |simple=yes}} - Increase ASPD for faster body relocation.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12414 |item=Guarana Candy |simple=yes}} - Increase ASPD for faster body relocation.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12030 |item=Box of Resentment |simple=yes}} - Increase Atk by 20.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12431 |item=Minor Brisket  |simple=yes}} - Increase Vit stat to 20 for 5 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12432 |item=Siroma Icetea  |simple=yes}} - Increase Dex stat to 20 for 5 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12430 |item=Warg Blood Cocktail  |simple=yes}} - Increase Int stat to 20 for 5 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12091 |item=Peach Cake  |simple=yes}} - Increase Dex stat to 6 for 30 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12086 |item=Chile Shrimp Gratin  |simple=yes}} - Increase Agi stat to 6 for 30 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12076 |item=Red Mushroom Wine  |simple=yes}} - Increase Int stat to 6 for 30 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12081 |item=Awfully Bitter Bracer  |simple=yes}} - Increase Vit stat to 6 for 30 mins.&lt;br>
{{Item List |id=12071 |item=Shiny Marinade Beef |simple=yes}} - Increase Str stat to 6 for 30 mins.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
NOTE: The +6 foods can be obtain from [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Sara%27s_Memory Sara's Memory].&lt;br>
::Siroma Icetea and Warg Blood Cocktail are only used for GOH build and for BOSS fights.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
I personally recommend you farm and create these potions yourselves since they are really easy to make and could save you millions in the future.&lt;br>
:{{Item List |id=32044 |item=Mega Minor Brisket 30m |simple=yes}} - This is the 30 minute version of Minor Brisket which gives +20 VIT.
:{{Item List |id=28627 |item=Mega Warg Blood Cocktail 30m |simple=yes}} - This potion gives +20 INT and is also very easy to make.
These consumables are the best way of increasing damage output of Tiger Cannon.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
:'''EXTRA POTIONS YOU MIGHT NEED'''
::{{Item List |id=12029 |item=Box of Gloom |simple=yes}} - Not enough instant cast? This item will give you Attention Concentrate which buffs your Dex more.&lt;br>
::{{Item List |id=12034 |item=Box of Panting |simple=yes}} - Mandarins are too expensive? Farm your potions! (You will need a Gym Passes to increase your weight limit since these potions weigh a lot).&lt;br>
:::*Opting for Box of Gloom than bringing an Abusive Robe is better in more ways. One, you will not be needing to swap Armors since you will only need Attention Concentrate during Boss fights. Two, Attention Concentrate only lasts for 60 seconds and you will be refreshing this buff during fight with the Boss. Three, you already have so many skills, potions, and buttons to be mindful of during a fight. So, opting to Abusive Robe is not the way to go.
:::*Box of Panting is only a good option to use when using the Tiger Cannon Build. This is just to help lessen the amount of Mandarins you are going to be using.
&lt;br>


&lt;br>

=='''''SURA 101'''''==
For those wondering how to survive and kill monsters as Sura below 115&lt;br>
You can 1 shot Gramps 85 - 115 with just one skill.&lt;br>
{{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} will be your leveling skill and farming skill.&lt;br>
:*Max out {{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon |simple=yes}} once you get 24 Skill points.&lt;br>
:*The idea is, you play like you are using a shotgun. You reload, shoot and reload again.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
::{{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} &lt;br>
:Why max out Rising Dragon first you ask? Rampage Blaster highly depends on the amount of spheres you have. More spheres equals more damage.&lt;br>
:You can use this technique as a finishing skill after every combo. With that setup you can do high damage in Gramps 145.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
For Gramps 145, you will be needing to max out Tiger Cannon and Fallen Empire.&lt;br>
You can contribute a really high amount of DPS when you use combo Tiger Cannon but you must use leeching gears to survive.&lt;br>
:For the skill combination;&lt;br>
::{{Skill List |id=2338 |skill=Rising Dragon |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2332 |skill=Rampage Blaster |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Champ! It consumes too much SP what should I do? Do not fret we Suras are blessed with a skill that restores SP in % form.&lt;br>
:After every combos, always make it a habit to consume unused spheres to replenish your SP.&lt;br>
:The simplest way to use this skill is to cast {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2340 |skill=Power Absorb |simple=yes}}&lt;br>
:Make it a habit to use this skill when your leech gears wont work.&lt;br>

&lt;br>

CHAMP! What skill do I use to regenerate spheres faster without casting Dangerous Soul Collect? We use the skill called {{Skill List |id=2346 |skill=Gentle Touch - Energy Gain |simple=yes}} .&lt;br>
:The best way for me to regenerate spheres are:&lt;br>
::*Use Reflect Shields such as {{Item List |id=2189 |item=Mad Bunny |slots=1 |simple=yes}} , Thorny Buckler, High Orc Card&lt;br>
:::When using a reflect shield, you get hit and at the same time you hit them back. The reflect damage will count as melee and will regenerate spheres.&lt;br>
::*Snap in a mob of monsters without getting destroyed.&lt;br>
::*Spam {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow |simple=yes}}, it is a really nice skill that pushes enemies around you away. Snap in a mob and spam.&lt;br>
&lt;br> 
&lt;br>
Champ you keep talking about leeching, I tried using tiger cannon on a monster but I did not leech any HP/SP? &lt;br>
:*To be able to leech HP/SP at a really high chance, you need to cast an AoE (area) skill at a very dense mob. More monsters hit = more chances of leech.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
How do you combo your skills to gain max damage output?
::{{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell |simple=yes}} > {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo |simple=yes}} &lt;br>
