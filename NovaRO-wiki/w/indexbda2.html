= Overview =
'''Work in progress'''

The Hyper Novice (HN for short) is a generalized specialist (or specialized generalist?) sort of class, focused on damage and armed with a wide variety of 1st and 2nd job skills to further enhance its capabilities while also greatly improving quality of life. This guide will hopefully help you get through the many great difficulties on the road to becoming a Hyper Novice. It is made in a way as if Hyper Novice is the first or one of the first characters you've created.

'''Notice: This guide is tailor-made for NovaRO. There are things here which may not be found in other servers.'''

|{{Skill List |id=268 |skill=Steel Body|simple=yes}}
|Self buff. On death and with Base EXP at 99-99.9%, level 5 Steel Body will trigger while also fully restoring HP and SP. Think of it as an extra life. Succeeding deaths will not trigger the skill. Relogging restores the extra life. At max level 250, it prevents AP loss and will always trigger on death, resulting in 25,000 zeny in savings per use of the Healer, if Heal AP is enabled (NovaRO custom feature, NPC found at lower right side of @go 50 or main office). If you're soloing and you still don't want to go back to your save point, bring a couple of extra Fly Wings and teleport around until you find a safe area. Relog to get the extra life back. This is not applicable to builds reliant on Super Novice Soul Link (e.g. Mage builds using Welding Wand or Illusion Thorn Staff of Darkness), as logging off removes the weapon unless the Soul Link is still in effect.

'''This skill will always trigger at Base Level 250. EXP cap is not required. ''' Credits to Yami and Ocean Star for pointing this out! /ene

|-
|{{Skill List |id=270 |skill=Critical Explosion|simple=yes}}
|Self buff. Enter the following text in '''public chat''' (Send to all) to gain Critical Explosion status. Unlike the normal Critical Explosion, it gives +50 CRIT instead of +20, is very, very spammable and doesn't require Spirit Spheres or anything. It will work only in increments of 10% Base EXP (10.0%, 20.5%, 30.3%, 40.7%, etc.) or at max level. Very useful for Melee builds.
* Dear angel, can you hear my voice?
* I am &lt;Your Name Here without the brackets> Super Novice~
* Help me out~ Please~ T_T
* Insert random text here
To quickly cast, put these lines in macro (ALT+M). '''Caution: Spamming too quickly will result in a 1-minute mute!''' But you can still use emotes though /ene
|-
|Bonus stats
|Reaching Job Level 70 without dying will grant +10 to all stats. Dying removes it, even well after.
Super Novice Spirit restores the bonus (1% chance). Or just click the Healer NPC (NovaRO custom feature) to get it back.

= Builds =
With almost all first job skills and some second job skills at their disposal, Hyper Novices can be built in many different ways. This section will tackle four different kinds of builds - Mage, Physical, Autocast and Flee Tank.

'''These builds are here for reference. You don't necessarily need to follow everything here exactly. &lt;u> Be free, experiment and tinker until you've built the Super Novice that suits you best.''' &lt;/u>

== Mage ==
[[File:Mage HN AncientJupe3.jpg|thumb|Mage build Hyper Novice treading carefully in the Ancient Factory.]]
[[File:Mage HN AncientJupe3.jpg|thumb|Placeholder screenshot.]]
'''(Description WIP)''' - The Super Novice can take one of two routes - Mage or Physical. The Mage Hyper Novice will go through many difficult trials along the way, but by transcending above the challenges, learning from other classes and Breaking the Rules along the way, they triumph, going from Super to Hyper, and I got writer's block. I still wonder what rules are they breaking... The rules of physics, the rule of law... or the rule of er... I don't know.

|Utility skill that deals Fire damage and pushes enemies away from you. Requires Sight to be active before use. Use this to push back enemies away from you or party member/s getting mobbed to death. This is a very effective means of escape when combined with Quagmire.

|-
|{{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust|simple=yes}}

All skills except for Rule Break in the Hyper Novice mage tree have 10 points. Feel free to choose which skills you want to speceialize in. I went for a mix of Wind and Water elements and got Rule Break for even more damage.

|8
|The upgraded version of Meteor Storm summons more powerful and faster meteors to rain down on enemies. Unlike the original Meteor Storm, enemies at the center of the AoE won't be hit by all meteors due the increased randomness of where they'll strike. However, at level 8 and above, there's around a 95% chance all meteors will land on target/s at the center of the AoE, as long as they aren't moving.

{{Item List nro|id=490015|slots=1 |item=Noblesse Magic Ring}}
|Equipment Set
|1 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coin}} per piece. Obtained by completing the account-wide [[Eden Academy]] questline.
|Good until level 125. It is highly recommended to complete the Eden Academy quest chain to get this over the other armors. While it gives less MATK compared to the Flattery Robe and is designed more towards an autospell build (see the build below), completing the full set gives quite a lot of bonuses, which include reduction in Variable Casting Time and Aftercast Delay, and can be further upgraded into the Imperial and Grace sets. Finally, to put the icing on the cake, they can be easily refined to +9 thanks to the {{Item List nro|id=100128|item=Noblesse Upgrade Ticket}}, for the low, low price of just a single {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=&lt;s>Penny&lt;/s>Paradise Coin}}!

|3 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}} per piece. Obtained by completing the account-wide [[Eden Academy]] quest chain.
|Good until level 150. An upgraded version of the Noblesse set, this costs triple the price but it introduces the player to enchanting. Like the Noblesse set, they can be easily refined to +9 thanks to the {{Item List nro|id=100129|item=Imperial Refine Ticket}}, for the low cost of just 3 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}}!

|Best by level 200, but these will still serve you well even at level 250 if you still don't have enough resources to get the best equipment. An upgraded version of the Imperial set, this is the pinnacle of Eden Academy equipment. Like the Noblesse and Imperial sets, they can be easily refined to +9 thanks to the {{Item List nro|id=100130|item=Grace Upgrade Ticket}}, for the low cost of just 4 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}}!

{{Item List nro |id=470093 |item=Advanced Paradise Shoes |simple=yes}}
|Armor and Shoes
|Eden Academy, level 100
|Your choice - full Grace Set will deal a little less damage but there is FCT reduction, while these two will deal a little more damage but there is no FCT reduction.
Strangely enough, equipping these two instead of their +9 Grace equivalents will deal more damage! However, there are no card slots, they cannot be upgraded and there is no Fixed Cast Time reduction. It is free and surprisingly effective.
|-
|{{Item List nro |id=550044 |item=Paradise Super Novice Wand |simple=yes}}
|Rod
|[[Eden Academy]], Base Level 100 and above
|Initially gives decent MATK but leveling up makes it significantly better. It is surprisingly strong, dealing more damage than a +15 Crimson Rod and a +8 Fortified Rod. Best of all, IT IS FREE! This humble Rod will serve you well, even beyond level 200 if much better rods are still out of reach. The glaring downsides - no slots and it can't be refined.
|-

When complete, the Advanced Angel's Set gives even better bonuses compared to the normal version, though the HP and SP boost remains the same. There is a small chance Lv. 1 Assumptio will be autocast if you're under attack. Beware of the After Cast Delay that happens each time the skill is autocast.
|-
|{{Item List |id=15146 |item=Flattery Robe |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

|Rod
|Bathory, Laurell Weinder
|Gives a good amount of MATK at high refines. Better to use this as material for making Freedom Sticks instead than refining it to +15.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2113 |item=Novice Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|Shield
|Lighthalzen Armory
|One of the best early-game shields the Super Novice could ever have - gives 20% resistance to all elements except Neutral.
|-
|{{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Faceworm Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|Garment

|Gives lots of DEF, some MDEF and various stats.

|-
|{{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal DEX Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|Footgear
|[[Old Glast Heim]]
[[Temporal Boots]]
|When paired to Giant Faceworm Skin, it gives a boost to HP and SP. If base DEX = 120, fixed cast time -0.5 seconds. This is very important, as you need to quickly cast spells and remain mobile. Try to get the Spell enchant. The second enchant can be Muscular Endurance or Lucky Day.

'''NOTICE: TEMPORAL BOOTS CANNOT BE WORN BY SUPER NOVICES IN OFFICIAL RO SERVERS!'''
|-
|{{Item List |id=2924 |item=Int Glove |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

|Eclage Glove Seller (10 Splendide Coins)
|This is the more offensive-oriented accessory. If your base INT is 110, equip two of these as it adds MATK for every 10 base INT and +1% MATK if base INT is 110.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2898 |item=Black Rosary |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

|If better rods like the ones listed below are still out of reach, this humble rod will still serve you well, even beyond level 200. It deals more damage than a +15 Crimson Rod and almost the same damage as a +15 Rutilus Stick-OS with the MATK +15% enchant.
|-
|{{Item List |id=1680 |item=Rutilus Stick-OS |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
|Rod
|[[Illusion]]
|A strong wand that gives After-Cast Delay reduction at +11, becoming even stronger with enchants. Try to get the MATK +15% enchant. The Paradise Super Novice Wand you get for FREE deals almost the same damage as this at +15. However, it does have its advantages. The Paradise SN Wand has no slots while this has 2, and it doesn't require Super Novice Soul Link to use, unlike the Welding Wand and Illusion Thorn Staff of Darkness.

A good upgrade over the Crimson Rod at high refines. Despite the Level 170 requirement, Super Novices with the SN Spirit buff can equip this at level 96. Even if the buff expires, it will remain equipped unless when logging off or dying and switching maps. Dying on the same map will not unequip - use Siegfried's Token or ask a someone to revive and the weapon will still be equipped.

Combining the {{Item List2 |id=24282 |item=Super Novice Shadow Gauntlet |simple=yes}} (with level 10 {{Skill Info|class=Soul Linker|id=9|skill=Increase SP Recovery}} of course) and this shield results in A LOT of MDEF pierce. 40% Racial MDEF pierce from this, 30% Normal MDEF pierce from the Gauntlet if {{Skill Info|class=Soul Linker|id=9|skill=Increase SP Recovery}} is level 10, and an extra 3% Normal MDEF pierce per refine rate of the Gauntlet. To get Boss MDEF pierce though, you need to enchant a {{Item List |id=28946 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}} with the "Ignore MDEF of Boss Monsters" enchant.
'''Unlike what the description says, it DOES NOT need the Super Magic Shadow Cape and Boots below to get the elemental damage bonuses, just the required refine level. Additionally, while the description in-game says that it ignores Physical Defense, it actually ignores Magic Defense. Finally, the MDEF pierce comes from this shield, the Super Novice Shadow Gauntlet and their refine levels, &lt;u>EXCLUDING&lt;/u> the other two items below. Type @battlestats or @bs to confirm.'''

===Tips and Tricks===

{| class="mw-collapsible wikitable mw-collapsed" style="width:100%"
|-
! style="background-color:#ADD8E6; color:Black;  width: 100% " |Strategy (WIP)
|-
|The Mage Build Hyper Novice is quite a challenge to level up due to Super Novice magic spells dealing adorable damage unless there's heavy investment involved. However, upon becoming Hyper Novice, the damage increases exponentially, and that's when its true power starts showing. &lt;!--- This strategy is focused more on a modestly built Hyper Novice with very little to no consumables used even in the thick of battle. 
'''This is subject to change depending on the market:''' As of the time of this writing, my idea of a "modestly built" Hyper Novice has the full Illusion Morpheus Set with the hood and shawl both at +9, a Paradise Super Novice Wand, a +9 Grace Super Novice Robe, a +9 Grace Magic Boots and a Novice Shield. --->


&lt;u>Super Novice:&lt;/u>

*Focus more on hit-and-run tactics by leveling up quick-cast skills like Fire Ball, Fire Wall and Soul Strike. 
*Safety Wall will be your wall of safety in dangerous situations but it will cost a lot of skill points. 
*DEX will be your primary stat, very closely followed by INT, so Variable Casting Time will be reduced. 
*Due to the Super Novice having absolutely atrocious HP and SP pools until level 99, your primary survival stat is AGI, not VIT. All the VIT and DEF in the world won't do much if you have a mere 700 HP. It's better to completely evade attacks instead of taking a hit with such low HP.
*Be very judicious in your movements and casting. You'll find yourself running out of SP very quickly or dying in just a single CRIT attack from Orc Zombies if you're not careful!
*When in a party... I have writer's block!


&lt;u>Ex. Super Novice&lt;/u>

When soloing, I get writer's block!

In a party setting, You'll be the secondary support, providing crowd control and extra buffs and heals. Quagmire, Storm Gust and Sightrasher will be your main crowd control skills. Once you see the tank and its lures approaching, cast Quagmire on the mobs to slow them down in order for the DPSes more easily dispose of them. Also watch out if the tank lured too many or if there are monsters coming from the side and rear - use Sightrasher to push them away or Storm Gust to freeze them in place. From time to time, you may also buff your teammates, provide additional heals with your cute Heals.


&lt;u>Hyper Novice&lt;/u>
WORK IN PROGRESS!!! Break the Rule of Er and destroy all who bring you down. Don't let them go, let them gravitate to you. Devastate their mental health, freeze them to the core, shock them with baleful thunder and call forth the wrath of the skies until they're no more. until they're no more. Beat the already dead horse by summoning the wrath of the skies and command the earth to swallow it whole, driving them down to a place worse than the deepest depths of the darkest hell.

'''(Description WIP)''' - The Super Novice can take one of two routes - Mage or Physical. The Physical Hyper Novice will have to deal with the inherent limitations of the Super Novice, having lower HP and SP than most other classes. However, by learning from other classes and improving their most notable skills, they Break through the Super Novice's Limits, transcending from Super into Hyper, and I got writer's block.

|-
|STR
|100-120
|Main stat. Increases ATK and carrying capacity.
|-
|AGI
|60-100
|Increases Attack Speed for greater damage and Flee for increased survivability while reducing the chances of getting inflicted by Bleeding and Sleep.
|-
|VIT
|70-80
|Increases Max HP while reducing the chances of getting Poisoned.
|-
|INT
|70-80
|Increases Max HP while reducing the chances of getting Silenced.
|-
|DEX
|60-80 / 120 (Ranged Hyper Novice builds)
|Increases Hit rate and minimum damage. For ranged builds, it is highly recommended to get sufficient INT and DEX to minimize Variable Cast Time when spamming Shield Chain Rush and Spiral Pierce Max.
|-
|LUK
|60-80 / 120 (Mega Sonic Blow builds)
|Increases CRIT Rate for even more damage and Perfect Dodge for even more survivability. Marginally increases Flee, Hit and overall damage as well. For Mega Sonic Blow builds, raise LUK to 120 to get as much CRIT Rate as possible while waiting for level 250 to access the Super Novice chant (see Hidden Skills above).

The example build below is an HP-leech focused build that sacrifices a little bit of power in exhcnage for increased survivability. It is ideal for slaughtering hordes of mobs, especially when a lack of power is compensated by increased survivability. Heal one's self by hurting others. The more, the merrier. But in exhcnage, become a slave to the RNG gods.

|Prerequisite for Safety Wall.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=12 |skill=Safety Wall|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|While it's optional, it is still a very handy skill and can be a life-saver in a pinch. Aside from blocking physical attacks at melee range, it can also prevent armor from getting broken from melee Armor Break attacks and shadow equipment from getting stripped. It can also block attacks reflected by Max Pain at melee range too!

Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone for each wall created, not the number of times the skill is cast.

|2
|Moving while hiding makes escaping or positioning for a raid easier.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=211 |skill=Steal Coin (Mug)|simple=yes}}
|4
|Steals zeny from an enemy. Higher levels means higher levels of success. This will draw the aggression of the enemy, because obviously it is very mad that you stole some of its hard-earned money.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=212 |skill=Back Stab|simple=yes}}
|2
|Usable only when facing the enemy's back. Causes physical damage that never misses, but it will make the enemy look back at you very angrily because it got back-stabbed.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=213 |skill=Raid (Sightless Mind)|simple=yes}}
|5
|Requires being hidden before use. This is your main source of damage. Causes physical damage to all enemies in a 7x7 area around you and chance to cause Blind and Stun. For 10 seconds, it increases damage, both physical and magical, to affected enemies by 30% for non-bosses and 15% for MVPs.

The skill is almost spammable, having no cooldown or after-cast delay. Just alternate Hide and Raid as quickly as possible. NovaRO's Turbo makes this significantly, significantly easier. '''See below on how to set this up''' the bomb. However, beware that getting hit will Hiding will reveal your location and will interrupt your Raid spamming.

|-
|{{Skill List |id=5075 |skill=Breakthrough|simple=yes}}
|5
|More HP, SP and received healing is always better. Max this.

|{{Skill List |id=5076 |skill=Help Me Angel!|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|Restores 1000 HP and 350 SP per second for 20 seconds, for a grand total of 20,000 HP and 7,000 SP. Affects self and all party members within a 31x31 area. When a party needs help to get out of a bad situation, this can help quite a lot. Beware of the ridiculously long 5-minute cooldown, so use this wisely.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5077 |skill=Transcendence|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|More HP, SP and healing power is always welcome. For this build, it is optional. Get this if more HP and SP are needed.

|Passive that ddds up to P.ATK +10. Higher levels increase the damage of all skills in the Physical tree.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5451 |skill=Double Bowling Bash|simple=yes}}
|7-10
|A powerful but rather clunky melee skill which deals damage in a 7x7 area around the target and knocks them back. More enemies caught results in more damage - at least 3 enemies are needed for maximum damage. However, its knockback is finicky and unpredictable. If there are 3 or less mobs, it will always push them back. If there are at least 4 mobs, sometimes they're knocked back, other times they're not.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5452 |skill=Mega Sonic Blow|simple=yes}}
|7-10
|A spammable single-target melee skill that can CRIT, perfect for those pesky mobs which love to Agi Up. Supposedly has a chance to Stun the target. Despite the description, its CRIT Rate is actually dependent on CRIT Rate, not the CRT trait.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5453 |skill=Shield Chain Rush|simple=yes}}
|7-10
|A spammable ranged physical attack which hits enemies in a 7x7 area around the target, applying a debuff that increases damage received by 10% (not applicable to boss monsters). Supposedly it can slow enemies down, but it seems like it's bugged for now.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5454 |skill=Spiral Pierce Max|simple=yes}}
|7-10
|A spammable single-target ranged attack with the ability to immobilize for 2 seconds. The larger the enemy, the less damage dealt.

|Armor
|Yuno - King's Shop
|Starter Armor, though it's a little expensive at 89,000 zeny. At least you're no longer wearing stinky rags that came from the dump ({{Item List |id=2352 |item=Tattered Novice Ninja Suit |simple=yes}}).

|MDEF+20
When complete, the Angel's Set gives a boost to HP and SP. There is a small chance Lv. 1 Assumptio will be autocast if you're under attack. The After Cast Delay that happens each time the skill is autocast makes equipping the whole set not too good.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2113 |item=Novice Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|Shield
|Lighthalzen Armory
|The combination of having frighteningly low HP until level 98 and the massive -10 ASPD penalty makes wearing a shield more of a detriment, reducing your damage while not providing enough protection despite its awesome 20% resistance to all elements except Neutral bonus. It will become much better at higher levels, so save it for later until you have way more HP and ASPD to compensate.

|Equipment Set
|1 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coin}} per piece. Obtained by completing the account-wide [[Eden Academy]] questline.
|Good until level 125. '''It is highly recommended to complete the Eden Academy quest chain to get this over the other armors.''' While it is designed more towards a melee autoattack CRIT build, completing the full set gives a lot of bonuses, which include increased HP and CRIT damage, and can be further upgraded into the Imperial and Grace sets. Finally, to put the icing on the cake, they can be easily refined to +9 thanks to the {{Item List nro|id=100128|item=Noblesse Upgrade Ticket}}, for the low, low price of just a single {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coin}}!

|3 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}} per piece. Obtained by completing the account-wide [[Eden Academy]] questline.
|Good until level 150. An upgraded version of the Noblesse set, this costs triple the price but it introduces the player to enchanting. Like the Noblesse set, they can be easily refined to +9 thanks to the {{Item List nro|id=100129|item=Imperial Refine Ticket}}, for the low cost of just 3 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}}!

|Equipment Set
|4 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}} per piece. Obtained by completing the account-wide [[Eden Academy]] questline.
|Best by level 200, but these will still serve you well even at level 250 if you still don't have enough resources to get the best equipment. An upgraded version of the Imperial set, this is the pinnacle of Eden Academy equipment. Like the Noblesse and Imperial sets, they can be easily refined to +9 thanks to the {{Item List nro|id=100130|item=Grace Upgrade Ticket}}, for the low cost of just 4 {{Item List nro|id=25223|item=Paradise Coins}}!

{{Item List nro |id=470069 |item=Paradise Luxury Boots |simple=yes}}
|Armor and Shoes
|Eden Academy, level 100
|Strangely enough, equipping these two instead of their +9 Grace equivalents will deal more damage in most situations! However, there are no card slots and they cannot be upgraded. It is free and surprisingly effective. They're good until you obtain a +7 Patent Blessed Knife or reach level 200, when the Grace set's slots get a big advantage in the form of the Shelter/Happiness Giver card combo for Melee builds or Observation/Empathizer card combo for Ranged builds.
|-
|{{Item List nro |id=510039 |item=Paradise Super Novice Dagger |simple=yes}}
|Weapon
|[[Eden Group]]
|Initially gives decent ATK but leveling up makes it significantly better. It is surprisingly powerful, dealing more damage than a +15 Crimson Mace and +15 Crimson Dagger! Best of all, IT IS FREE! This humble dagger will serve you well, even beyond level 200 if much better weapons are still out of reach. The glaring downsides - no slots and it can't be refined.
|-
|{{Item List |id=18776 |item=Advanced Angel's Kiss |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

|Dagger
|Desert Wolf, Pasana, Porcellio, Skeleton General, Sleeper, Whikebain
|An easy-to-get dagger with good attack power, becoming stronger the higher your Base Level and the weapon's refine rate. However, its damage somewhat falls off the larger the enemy (100% - 75% - 50% damage against small, medium and large-sized enemies respectively).

|An easy-to-get mace with good attack power, becoming stronger the higher your Base Level and the weapon's refine rate. This has less overall damage unless carded with Sidewinder. It has better size modifiers compared to the dagger (75% - 100% - 100% damage against small, medium and large-sized enemies respectively) and it has a less severe Attack Speed penalty as well (-10 vs -15).

|-
|{{Item List |id=16040 |item=Crimson Mace |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
|Mace
|Am Mut, Earth Petite, Erend, Marionette,  Kobold Leader, Li Me Mang Ryang / Jing Guai, Solider
|Compared to the Vicious Mind Mace, this has less ATK and no enchants but has 2 slots, allowing for more options for carding. Get a Neutral element mace. At +15, it deals slightly less damage (around 3%) than a +4 Meteor Strike. While significantly more expensive, the greatest benefits are increased versatility and weight savings (2000 weight saved!). You're not carrying an overloaded Class-8 Peterbilt Truck on one hand anymore!
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=500007 |item=Hypocrisy Machine |slots=3 |simple=yes}}

|If the Patent Blessed Knife is too expensive, then this is a really good choice. '''Due to the Super Novice's HUGE -17 ASPD penalty when wielding One-Handed Swords, it is highly recommended to refine this to +7 for the 20% ASPD boost.''' Very good for any Physical build, whether it is spamming Raid, autoattacking, or throwing Shield Chains if you have the Super Power Shadow Set (see below) to enable it.
|-

[[Temporal Boots]]
|When paired with a Giant Faceworm Skin, it gives a boost to HP and SP. If base LUK = 120, Crit Damage +30% and MDEF +5. Greatly boosts autoattack damage.

|Upper Headgear

|Requires a non-slotted {{Item List nro|id=410079|item=Deep Blue Sunglasses}} and {{Item List |id=6396 |item=Spiritual Auger |simple=yes}} to slot. A cool-looking slotted Middle Headgear that can be enchanted. Try to get ATK enchants.

|Requires a non-slotted {{Item List nro|id=400001|item=Victory Wing Ears}} and {{Item List |id=6396 |item=Spiritual Auger |simple=yes}} to slot. A cool-looking slotted Middle Headgear that can be enchanted. Try to get ATK enchants. This is slightly more preferrable to the Deep Blue Sunglasses because of the Aftercast Delay reduction.
|-
|{{Item List nro|id=18754|item=Blood Sucker}}
|Lower Headgear
|{{Item List nro|id=28620|item=Lower Hat Box}}

|{{Item List nro |id=510039 |item=Paradise Super Novice Dagger |simple=yes}}
|Dagger
|[[Eden Group]]
|If better weapons like the ones listed below are still way out of reach, this humble dagger will still serve you well, even beyond level 200. It deals more damage than a +15 Crimson Mace, +15 Crimson Dagger and about as much damage as a +8 Fortified Edge. As the content gets tougher though, start saving Zeny and materials for better weapons.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=500007 |item=Hypocrisy Machine |slots=3 |simple=yes}}
|One-Handed Sword
|Broken Security Beta, Verporte
|One of, if not the best weapons for Physical Build Hyper Novices, ranged or melee. An indestructible sword (not applicable to refining) that grows stronger the more it is refined while having an awesome quirk - it has 3 card slots instead of the usual 2. Refine this weapon to &lt;s>infinity&lt;/s> +11 and beyond.
|-
|{{Item List nro |id=510072 |item=Blessed Knife-LT |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
|Dagger
|[[Ancient Hero]]
|Currently the most powerful evolution of the Blessed Knife, it grows stronger the more it is refined and graded. Level 10 Fatal Menace is granted at +7, just like its lesser Patent form. Best paired with {{Item List2|id=470094 |item=Hero Boots-LT|slots=1}}
'''This part needs testing: +11 Blessed Knife-LT vs +12 Hypocrisy Machine, so this is purely theory and speculation:''' Unless you have a {{Item List nro |id=28946 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}} with the "Remove Size Penalty" enchant or {{Item List2 |id=24150 |item=Infinity Shadow Ring |simple=yes}} and {{Item List2 |id=24151 |item=Infinity Shadow Bracer |simple=yes}} with a combined refine of +15, its damage will be on par or just negligibly higher compared to a Hypocrisy Machine at best, even when comboed with Hero Boots-LT. Then there's the fact that it has just 2 slots compared to the Hypocrisy Machine's 3.

|A fantastic shield that provides many bonuses, especially at higher refines. Try to get the "Remove weapon's size penalty enchant", AKA free Drake Card, especially when you plan on using the {{Item List nro |id=510072 |item=Blessed Knife-LT |slots=2 |simple=yes}} as your main weapon.
|-
|{{Item List nro |id=460018 |item=Illusion Silver Guard |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

|Reduces VCT and ACD depending on refine rate. While it doesn't have the Purified Knight's Shield's Drake Card enchant, its VCT and ACD reductions are still very useful for all builds.

|Improved version of the Illusion Engine Wing. Increases HP by 1500 and adds 100 HP every 2 refine rate. At +7, it increases attack speed.

|Footgear
|[[Ancient Juperos]]
|The current final form of the Ancient Hero Boots, this pair of shiny shoes gives quite a lot of bonuses, especially at high refines and better grades. It's an upgrade over the Automatic Leg A-type at high refines AND when paired with the {{Item List nro |id=510072 |item=Blessed Knife-LT |slots=2 |simple=yes}}. Try to aim for a +11 Grade C at least.
|-

|-
|{{Item List nro|id=24619|item=Super Power Shadow Glove}}
|Shadow Gear
|[[Ancient Laboratory]]
|An improved version of the already really good Super Novice Shadow Gauntlet and the centerpiece of the Super Power Shadow Set. For Hyper Novices, only this is needed. The brooch and bangle are unnecessary.

'''Unlike what the description says, it DOES NOT need the Super Power Shadow Bangle and Brooch below to get the DEF pierce, just this glove and the SN Shadow Shield below and the refine rate of both. Type @battlestats or @bs to confirm.'''

|Shadow Gear
|[[Zaedronath]]
|Nullifies all annoying and pesky weapon size penalties if both have a total refine of 15 and above. If getting the "Remove weapon's size penalty" enchant on a PKS is too elusive or if the PKS isn't the best for you, then these two will do the trick.

|Increases melee and ranged physical damage by 4% every 3 refine rate. If having 120 Base STR or DEX is a bit too much and you want more stat flexibility, this is a very good alternative, especially when paired with {{Card |id=300422 Is the Catherine Gaebolg card implemented?}} for melee builds or {{Card |id=300426 Crux Findel}} for ranged builds.

|-
|The Physical Build Hyper Novice is about repeatedly spamming a variety of skills berserker style, shredding enemies into Chef's Kiss mincemeat.


&lt;u>Super Novice:&lt;/u>

*You can focus on hard-hitting skills like Bash and Mammonite, or deal sustained damage over time with Double Attack. Both can be amplified with Provoke and Magnum Break.
*Like in the Mage build above, Safety Wall will still be your wall of safety in dangerous situations if you wish to have it, but it will cost a lot of skill points.
*Go for a more or less even spread of STR, AGI and DEX, with AGI and DEX being a little higher for increased survivability and actually landing hits. Add some INT to the side for SP Recovery and better Heals. Put remaining points into VIT or LUK, whichever is preferable.
*Watch your surroundings and always be ready to move out of harm's way. Archer-type monsters will can snipe from a distance and will often land hits, while mage-types like Evil Druid can cast a spell out of nowhere, and it can be potentially fatal.

When in a party... I have writer's block.


&lt;u>Ex. Super Novice&lt;/u>
When soloing, I get writer's block!

In a party setting, I also get writer's block!


&lt;u>Hyper Novice&lt;/u>
WORK IN PROGRESS!!! Shielding, throwing, never for defending. Hard head, bowling ball, striking not sparing. Sonically blowing, spiral piercing, stops the mega fighting.

== Melee Autospell (Leveling, WIP) ==
[[File:Autospell SN.jpg|thumb|Melee Autospell Super Novice in the [[Geffen Magic Tournament]] Instance.]]
The main inspirations are two awesome Super Novices that pioneered the build: '''Shin Chan''' and '''Yami Reborn'''. The Melee Autospell is an early-game leveling build that is quite cheap to build, focused mainly on dealing Neutral Element magic damage from the Noblesse, Imperial and Grace Magic Sets, which enables autocasting Psychic Wave when autoattacking. It is a jack-of-all-trades kind of build, having a little bit of everything from the three other builds in this guide.

=== Stats ===
AGI and INT are the most important stats. This enables the autospells to proc often and deal as much damage as possible

{| class="wikitable"
! style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; width: 100px" | Stat
! style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; width: auto" | Amount
! style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; width: auto" | Notes
|-
|STR
|1+
|Leftover. Mainly used for increased carrying capacity or if needed, increased Physical damage.
|-
|AGI
|100-120
|Higher ASPD means higher chances of autocasting various spells.
|-
|VIT
|70-80
|Mainly for survivability and preventing bad statuses like Poison.
|-
|INT
|110-125
|Higher INT means higher magic damage. If using a Napeo Card, raise INT to 125.
|-
|DEX
|60-70
|Get sufficient amounts of DEX to land hits. Misses will not autocast spells.
|-
|LUK
|50-60
|Higher LUK increases CRIT chances as well as slightly increasing overall damage.

|1

|-
|{{Skill List |id=26 |skill=Teleport|simple=yes}}
|1
|Save weight, money, inventory space and the grind for a Creamy Card (or the zeny to buy it)!
|-

|3-10
|Mainly for self-healing purposes. But it can also be used to heal party members and damage Undead race monsters.

|VERY IMPORTANT skill for this build - max this. Gives a movement speed boost and more ASPD.

That's pretty much it. These are the most essential skills of this build. Afterwards, you're free to choose any skills you like. My skill build is below.

|-
| style="background-color: #FFFFCC; text-align: center;" colspan="4" | '''Super Novice'''
|-
|{{Skill List |id=48 |skill=Double Attack|simple=yes}}
|8-10
|Adds a chance of attacking twice - 50% chance at level 10. This makes damage output a little more stable, lessening the reliance on the Earthquake proc from the Faceworm Queen's Leg.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=50 |skill=Steal|simple=yes}}
|5
|Steal items from one target. Prerequisite for Hiding.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=51 |skill=Hiding|simple=yes}}
|1
|Causes the player to become invisible, but unable to move. Use this to escape a losing battle. It is useless against Insect and Demon race and Boss monsters. Prerequisite for Tunnel Drive.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=52 |skill=Envenom|simple=yes}}
|3
|Prerequisite for Detoxify. Poison-element melee poke that has a chance to cause Poison status.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=53 |skill=Detoxify|simple=yes}}
|1
|Detoxifies poisoned enemies. Since Archbishops don't have a skill that cures Poison, Thief Classes are (usually) too busy doing their thing and some players may forget to bring Green Herbs, you can use this to get rid of the Poison.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=6 |skill=Provoke|simple=yes}}
|5
|Mainly used as a prerequisite for Endure. You can also use this to lure bad and scary monsters to you, if your insults and middle finger succeed.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=8 |skill=Endure|simple=yes}}
|1
| Prevents your character from flinching due to being hit (up to 7 hits). Level 1 is more than enough to escape a losing battle, as higher levels add only duration and MDEF, not the number of hits you can sustain before flinching.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=22 |skill=Divine Protection|simple=yes}}
|5
|Prerequisite for Blessing and Angelus. Reduces damage from Demon and Undead race enemies.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=34 |skill=Blessing|simple=yes}}
|10
|Raises a target's STR, INT and DEX. More INT means stronger autospell damage and more DEX makes you land your hits more, which means more autospell procs.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=27 |skill=Warp Portal|simple=yes}}
|4
|Warps up to 8 players to your save point and 3 other spots of choice. Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone per use. Use /memo to add a spot.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=25 |skill=Pneuma|simple=yes}}
|1
|A very useful skill that makes ranged physical attacks miss in a 3x3 area. Some powerful MVP attacks, such as Hell's Judgement, can be blocked by this. 
Note that Safety Wall and Pneuma can't be within a 3x3 area of each other. You can use this skill to prevent some monsters (e.g. Hibram, Magaleta) from casting Safety Wall.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=35 |skill=Cure|simple=yes}}
|1
|Cures Blind, Confuse and Silence.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=10 |skill=Sight|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Sightrasher.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=20 |skill=Lightning Bolt|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Sightrasher.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=16 |skill=Stone Curse|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Earth Spike.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=12 |skill=Safety Wall|simple=yes}}
|10
|Creates a barrier on the ground that blocks melee physical attacks. You can use this to protect your teammates or to protect yourself if you're starting to get mobbed.
You may combine this with Quagmire to further reduce the mobs' AGI and DEX, making you harder to hit and making the wall last even longer.

Safety Wall also blocks Hell's Judgement at melee range (1-4 cells from the enemy).
Finally, Safety Wall and Pneuma can't be cast within a 3x3 area of each other. That means if there's an annoying monster (e.g. Kiel-D01, Hibram, Magaleta) that's casting Pneuma and preventing your teammates from doing ranged physical damage, just cast this skill right next to those mobs and they won't be able to protect themselves from ranged physical attacks.

Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone for each wall created, not the number of times the skill is cast.
|-
| style="background-color: #FFFFCC; text-align: center;" colspan="4" | '''Expanded Super Novice'''
|-
|{{Skill List |id=210 |skill=Snatcher (Gank)|simple=yes}}
|4
|Automatically steals something from an enemy while attacking. The success chance depends on the level of "Steal" learned.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=213 |skill=Tunnel Drive|simple=yes}}
|2
|Moving while hiding makes escaping or positioning for a raid easier.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=211 |skill=Steal Coin (Mug)|simple=yes}}
|4
|Steals zeny from an enemy. Higher levels means higher levels of success. This will draw the aggression of the enemy, because apparently theft is bad even for bad guys and monsters.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=212 |skill=Back Stab|simple=yes}}
|2
|Usable only when facing the enemy's back. Causes physical damage that never misses, but it will make the enemy look back at you very angrily because they hate backstabbers.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=213 |skill=Raid (Sightless Mind)|simple=yes}}
|1
|Requires being hidden before use. Mainly for supportive purposes, by boosting your own damage or your party's overall damage. Non-boss enemies receive 30% more physical and magic damage and boss enemies receive 15% physical and magic damage for 10 seconds.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=72 |skill=Status Recovery|simple=yes}}
|1
|Cures Stun, Frozen, Stone, Stasis and White Imprison.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=81 |skill=Sightrasher|simple=yes}}
|1
|Utility skill that deals Fire element magic damage and pushes enemies away. Requires Sight to be active before use. Use this to push back enemies away from you or party member/s getting mobbed to death. This is a very effective means of escape when combined with Quagmire.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=90 |skill=Earth Spike|simple=yes}}
|3
|Prerequisite for Heaven's Drive. Essentially an Earth Bolt.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=91 |skill=Heaven's Drive|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Quagmire. Use this skill to reveal and damage hidden enemies that are a good distance from you.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=92 |skill=Quagmire|simple=yes}}
|5
|Very useful utility skill that slows down enemies while also cutting their DEX and AGI. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=248 |skill=Faith|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|Adds up to 2000HP and increases Holy resistance by up to 50%. Get this skill if more HP is needed.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=66 |skill=Impositio Manus|simple=yes}}
|3-5
|Provides additional ATK and MATK to you and the whole party. Makes everyone kill and heal things a little more effectively.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=68 |skill=Aspersio|simple=yes}}
|1-5
|Endows a target's weapon with the Holy property. Consumes 1 Holy Water per use.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=74 |skill=Magnificat|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|Optional. Doubles the caster and party's SP Recovery rate for a duration. If you have SP consumption issues and SP-healing items are too expensive, then add some points here. When combined with the skill "Increase SP Recovery", SP should be much less of a problem.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=70 |skill=Sanctuary|simple=yes}}
|7
|Besides healing party members, this can also be used to heal yourself while tanking in case the main support/s is either disabled, too busy or too far from you.
At level 7, it heals 777HP per second. Higher levels aren't necessary as they add only duration. Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone per use.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=75 |skill=Gloria|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|Adds 30 LUK, which means more CRIT, ATK and MATK.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5075 |skill=Breakthrough|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|Add points to this skill if more HP, SP and ATK are needed. Optional.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5076 |skill=Help Me Angel!|simple=yes}}
|1
|Restores 1000 HP and 350 SP per second for 20 seconds for a grand total of 20,000 HP and 7,000 SP. Affects self and all party members within a 31x31 area. When a party needs help to get out of a bad situation, this can help quite a lot. Beware of the ridiculously long 5-minute cooldown, so use this wisely. Very wisely.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5077 |skill=Transcendence|simple=yes}}
|5
|More HP, SP, MATK and healing power is always better.

|{{Item List |id=13090 |item=Faceworm Queen Leg |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
|Dagger
|Faceworm Queen
|This is one of the best weapons for this build. It gives decent attack and a good amount of MATK. When physically attacking, there's a chance to transform into the Faceworm Queen. When that happens, physical attacks will have a very high chance of casting Level 1 Earthquake. Unlike the article in iROwiki, Earthquake deals Neutral element damage '''BASED ON MATK''', not ATK. Level 1 Earthquake deals three hits of 300% '''MATK''' in an 11x11 area around you. The Earthquake proc will be your main source of damage.
|-
|{{Item List |id=2113 |item=Novice Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
|Shield
|Lighthalzen Armory
|The best shield the Super Novice could ever have - gives 20% resistance to all elements except Neutral. For this build, '''don't equip a shield unless it's necessary'''. Super Novices suffer a BIG attack speed penalty (-10 ASPD) when equipping shields and it will make your offense a lot weaker.

{| class="mw-collapsible wikitable mw-collapsed" style="width:100%"
|-
! style="background-color:#FFFFCC;  width: 100% " |Strategy
|-
|The strategy will be based on my version of the Melee Autospell build.
The playstyle is fairly simple - just point, click and watch the monsters get quaked, burned, frozen, electrocuted, Psychic Wave'd and more! Like the Meteor Strike Melee above, this build is more suited to solo play, but it can still be good in a party because of its well-rounded mix of offense, survivability and support.

&lt;u>When soloing:&lt;/u>

Even if your gears aren't the best, this build can still solo dungeons and some instances quite well - just don't lure too many monsters. Use your arsenal of skills in order to help you fight and defend against monsters more effectively. Use Safety Wall in order to protect yourself from attacks, especially if you're starting to get mobbed. If there are too many, cast Endure, then cast Sightrasher and follow up with Quagmire for a quick escape. Heal, rebuff and go back again until the mobs are wiped out. With good enough gears, this build can deal with some mobs and MVPs with Reflect Shield, like Hard Amdarais. By endowing the weapon with the element of said mob or MVP (e.g. Shadow for Hard Amdarais via Cursed Water), the damage dealt is very low, resulting in miniscule or manageable from Reflect Shield. The barrage of autospells does most of the damage.


&lt;u>When in a party:&lt;/u>

You'll usually be the secondary DPS and secondary support but on a few occasions, secondary tank. Soften enemies that come from the sides and rear so that the main DPSs can more easily kill the mobs. Help the main support by providing extra heals, buffs and crowd control. The high AGI of this build also grants a bit of tanking ability - you can help the main tank with luring enemies to the party. Just be aware of the Flee penalty. If there are 2 monsters attacking you, each additional monster will reduce your max Flee by 10%. That means if there are 12 monsters attacking you, your actual Flee is '''ZERO'''.

== Flee Tank (Leveling) ==
[[File:Be Brave Little One.jpg|thumb|An old screenshot showing a Flee Tank build Super Novice with (formerly) just 12,000HP, tanking the final boss in [[Temple of the Demon God|demon god]].]]
[[File:Raku Flee Tank.jpg|thumb|That's A LOT of Flee!]]
&lt;!---
[[File:High Flee when Naked.png|300px|right|thumb|Even without a single piece of equipment and shadow gears, Flee is over 500 with just simple buffs.]]--->

The Flee Tank is an early-game support-focused build that is quite cheap to build. It is mainly used to lure mobs in Gramps 85-175 and 175-200 to a lesser extent while providing decent support. Upon becomong a Hyper Novice, one must choose between going Physical or Magical, with optional Flee Tank characteristics by raising CON.

&lt;!--- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVPJL5Ph9g0 Old video showing a Flee Tank build SN in action]. In this case, he takes the role of tank in [[Temple of the Demon God]]. --->

|-
|{{Skill List |id=49 |skill=Increase Dodge|simple=yes}}
|10
|VERY IMPORTANT. This will be your main source of Flee. Adds 30 Flee at level 10.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=50 |skill=Steal|simple=yes}}
|Optional (5)
|Steal items from one target. Prerequisite for Hiding. Get this only if you're planning to get "Raid", a skill that makes enemies receive 30% more damage (15% if boss protocol or MVP).
|-
|{{Skill List |id=51 |skill=Hiding|simple=yes}}
|Optional (1)
|Causes the player to become invisible, but unable to move. Use this to escape a losing battle. It is useless against Insect and Demon race and Boss monsters. Prerequisite for Tunnel Drive.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=52 |skill=Envenom|simple=yes}}
|3
|Prerequisite for Detoxify. Poison-element melee poke that has a chance to cause Poison status.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=53 |skill=Detoxify|simple=yes}}
|1
|Detoxifies poisoned enemies. Since Archbishops don't have a skill that cures Poison, Thief Classes are (usually) too busy doing their thing and some players may forget to bring Green Herbs, you can use this to get rid of the Poison.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=6 |skill=Provoke|simple=yes}}
|5
|Mainly used as a prerequisite for Endure. You can also use this to lure bad and scary monsters to you, if your insults and middle finger succeed.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=8 |skill=Endure|simple=yes}}
|1-2
|Prevents your character from flinching due to being hit (up to 7 hits). Level 1 is more than enough to escape a losing battle, as higher levels add only duration and MDEF, not the number of hits you can sustain before flinching. You have two choices - Impositio Manus or this. Take Impositio Manus for more buffs. Take this skill to lure, tank and escape better.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=9 |skill=Increase SP Recovery|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|If more SP recovery is needed, get this skill.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=24 |skill=Ruwach|simple=yes}}
|1
|Reveals and deals Holy Element magic damage to hidden enemies.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=26 |skill=Teleport|simple=yes}}
|2
|Save weight, money, inventory space and the grind for a Creamy Card (or the zeny to buy it)!
|-
|{{Skill List |id=27 |skill=Warp Portal|simple=yes}}
|4
|Warps up to 8 players to your save point and 3 other spots of choice. Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone per use. Use /memo to add a spot.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=25 |skill=Pneuma|simple=yes}}
|1
|A very useful skill that makes ranged physical attacks miss in a 3x3 area. Some powerful MVP attacks, such as Hell's Judgement, can be blocked by this. 
Note that Safety Wall and Pneuma can't be within a 3x3 area of each other. You can use this skill to prevent some monsters (e.g. Hibram, Magaleta) from casting Safety Wall. When facing a mix of melee and ranged enemies, should you decide to cast Pneuma, make sure to place it in the cell behind you so that ranged physical DPS classes can hit the melee mobs attacking you.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=35 |skill=Cure|simple=yes}}
|1
|Cures Blind, Confuse and Silence.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=28 |skill=Heal|simple=yes}}
|10
|Heals you and your allies. When you need to heal yourself while tanking, take note of the Cast Delay if you're spamming Safety Wall.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Increase AGI|simple=yes}}
|10
|VERY IMPORTANT skill for this build - max this. Gives a movement speed boost, more ASPD and more Flee for tanking.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=22 |skill=Divine Protection|simple=yes}}
|5
|Prerequisite for Blessing and Angelus. Reduces damage from Demon and Undead race enemies.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=34 |skill=Blessing|simple=yes}}
|10
|Raises a target's STR, INT and DEX. More DEX means reduced cast time and more Hit, which also means better Safety Wall spamming when tanking.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=10 |skill=Sight|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Sightrasher.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=20 |skill=Lightning Bolt|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Sightrasher.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=16 |skill=Stone Curse|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Earth Spike.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=45 |skill=Attention Concentrate|simple=yes}}
|10
|Gives a lot of DEX and AGI. Max this one.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=12 |skill=Safety Wall|simple=yes}}
|10 
|A very versatile skill with many uses. Creates a barrier on the ground that blocks melee physical attacks. You can use this to protect your teammates or to enhance your tanking abilities.
If Flee and Perfect Dodge aren't enough, this skill will enable you to tank larger groups of monsters and even a few MVPs. With your high Flee, &lt;u>Safety Wall tanking with this build is easier compared to other classes&lt;/u> ('''disputable'''), as a missed attack won't count as a hit and won't reduce the wall's durability.
You may combine this with Quagmire to further reduce the mobs' AGI and DEX, making you even harder to hit and making the wall last even longer.

Safety Wall also blocks Hell's Judgement at melee range (1-4 cells from the enemy).
Finally, Safety Wall and Pneuma can't be cast within a 3x3 area of each other. That means if there's an annoying monster (e.g. Kiel-D01, Hibram, Magaleta) that's casting Pneuma and preventing your teammates from doing ranged physical damage, just cast this skill right next to those mobs and they won't be able to protect themselves from ranged physical attacks.

Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone for each wall created, not the number of times the skill is cast.
|-
| style="background-color: #D0F0C0; text-align: center;" colspan="4" |Expanded Super Novice
|-
|{{Skill List |id=210 |skill=Snatcher (Gank)|simple=yes}}
|Optional (4)
|Automatically steals something from an enemy while attacking. The success chance depends on the level of "Steal" learned.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=213 |skill=Tunnel Drive|simple=yes}}
|Optional (2)
|Moving while hiding makes escaping or positioning for a raid easier.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=211 |skill=Steal Coin (Mug)|simple=yes}}
|Optional (4)
|Steals zeny from an enemy. Higher levels means higher levels of success. This will draw the aggression of the enemy, because apparently theft is bad even for bad guys and monsters.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=212 |skill=Back Stab|simple=yes}}
|Optional (2)
|Usable only when facing the enemy's back. Causes physical damage that never misses, but it will make the enemy look back at you very angrily because they hate backstabbers.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=213 |skill=Raid (Sightless Mind)|simple=yes}}
|Optional (1)
|Requires being hidden before use. Mainly used for supportive purposes by the party's overall damage. Non-boss enemies receive 30% more physical and magic damage and boss enemies receive 15% physical and magic damage for 10 seconds. &lt;br> '''WARNING:''' Mobs can lose aggro while you're hidden and it can attack the party and potentially cause mayhem! Make sure you are properly cornered to lessen the chances of mobs losing aggro.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=72 |skill=Status Recovery|simple=yes}}
|1
|Cures Stun, Frozen, Stone, Stasis and White Imprison.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=81 |skill=Sightrasher|simple=yes}}
|1
|Utility skill that deals Fire element magic damage and pushes enemies away from you. Cast Sight first then this skill. Use this to push back enemies away from you or party member/s getting mobbed to death. This is an effective means of escape when combined with Quagmire.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=90 |skill=Earth Spike|simple=yes}}
|3
|Prerequisite for Heaven's Drive. Essentially an Earth Bolt.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=91 |skill=Heaven's Drive|simple=yes}}
|1
|Prerequisite for Quagmire. Use this skill to reveal and damage hidden enemies that are a good distance from you.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=92 |skill=Quagmire|simple=yes}}
|5
|Very useful utility skill that slows down enemies while also cutting their DEX and AGI. 
This will make you lure and flee-tank larger groups of monsters more effectively.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=248 |skill=Faith|simple=yes}}
|10
|It adds up to 2000HP and increases Holy resistance by up to 50%. This must be maxed. More HP and Holy resistance means more survivability.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=249 |skill=Auto Guard|simple=yes}}
|10
|Complements the high Flee very well, making you even harder to hit. Has a 30% chance to block most physical attacks (melee, range and physical skills) at level 10.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=70 |skill=Sanctuary|simple=yes}}
|Optional (7)
|Besides healing party members, this can also be used to heal yourself while tanking in case the main support/s is either disabled, too busy or too far from you.
At level 7, it heals 777HP per second. Higher levels aren't necessary as they add only duration. Consumes 1 Blue Gemstone per use.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=75 |skill=Gloria|simple=yes}}
|Optional (5)
|Adds 30 LUK, which means more CRIT, ATK and MATK.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=66 |skill=Impositio Manus|simple=yes}}
|3-5
|Provides additional ATK and MATK to you and the whole party. Makes everyone kill and heal things a little more effectively.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=68 |skill=Aspersio|simple=yes}}
|1-5
|Endows a target's weapon with the Holy property. Consumes 1 Holy Water per use.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=74 |skill=Magnificat|simple=yes}}
|Optional (1-5)
|Doubles SP recovery of the caster and the party. If 10 levels of the skill Increase SP Recovery is too much, this is an excellent substitute.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=365 |skill=Magic Crasher|simple=yes}}
|Optional
|Somewhat long-range poke mainly use to get back lost aggro. Use this to lure monsters to you and away from the party and spam it to keep them from targeting other party members. If this fails, get back the aggro by autoattacking.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5075 |skill=Breakthrough|simple=yes}}
|5
|More HP, SP and received healing is always better. Max this.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5076 |skill=Help Me Angel!|simple=yes}}
|1
|Restores 1000 HP and 350 SP per second for 20 seconds, for a grand total of 20,000 HP and 7,000 SP. Affects self and all party members within a 31x31 area. When a party needs help to get out of a bad situation, this can help quite a lot. Beware of the ridiculously long 5-minute cooldown, so use this wisely. Very wisely.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5077 |skill=Transcendence|simple=yes}}
|5
|More HP, SP and healing power is always better. Max this.

|[[File:Super Novice in Bio5.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Support/Off-Tank build Super Novice helping the party's main tank by fending off a Kathryne Cheiron attacking from the rear in Tomb of the Fallen (Bio 5 / Nightmare BioLabs).]]
This build works best with a partner or in a party.

&lt;u>When soloing:&lt;/u>

This build's soloing capability is limited due to its meager damage. It is better to go for a Melee build (see above) and sacrifice a bit of Flee for significantly increased damage. With high Flee, up to 6 enemies (40% flee penalty) can be tanked without much problems, though that number will vary depending on the enemies' Hit rate. You may get Super Novice Spirit and use a {{Item List |id=18666 |item=CD in Mouth |simple=yes}} to enhance your autoattacks, but beware of the After-Cast Delay that comes after each autocast. In case you're being mobbed, cast Sightrasher to push away mobs, then cast Quagmire to slow down the mobs in order to escape.


&lt;u>When partnered with a DPS:&lt;/u>

You'll double-duty as support and tank. First, the party window must be open at all times with the lock function activated and with buffs shown (type @showbuffs). Protect your partner and keep him/her alive at all costs. Buff, heal and cast Safety Wall or Pneuma on your partner and yourself when necessary, but be aware of your very low SP and the Cast Delay after casting some skills. Lure, but not too much - be aware of the Flee penalty. It's a 10% reduction of your max Flee for every additional monster if 2 are already attacking you. When 12 or more monsters are attacking you, your actual Flee is '''ZERO, '''no matter how much Flee you have. If you run into the unfortunate situation of luring too many monsters, hope that your partner is nearby and not busy or disabled. If not, cast Sightrasher to push the mobs away, then cast Quagmire to slow them down. This combo will either guarantee an escape, buy some time, or make killing mobs easier. When a particularly powerful monster (including MVPs) is aiming for your partner, draw the monster away. Make sure it is ALWAYS aggro'd on you, and let your partner kill it.


&lt;u>When in a party:&lt;/u>

This time, you'll be both secondary support and tank, as your party is likely to have a main tank and at least one Arch Bishop (AB) as the main support. You'll be helping out the AB, being the secondary source of heals and buffs, providing additional Safety Walls and Pneumas and crowd control with Sightrasher and Quagmire. While doing support, you're also going to tank. While the main tank is luring monsters from the front, your job is to keep the monsters coming from the sides and rear from reaching and doing damage to your party, especially the main support/s and DPS, moreso if they're squishy. If the main tank is a Sura, there might be a few occasions that you'll have to provide cover while Steel Body is being recast. In case the main tank is disabled or has internet issues, you'll be the substitute. It is somewhat similar to when partnered with a DPS, except it's easier as you now have a whole party to more easily dispose of the monsters you lured while the main support heals.


&lt;u>As the main tank:&lt;/u>

High Flee does most of the tanking work, not the Safety Wall spam or the "Steel Body on death" after accumulating over 5 billion EXP. Safety Wall is mainly used as an extra precautionary measure. However, in situations where you're surrounded by large numbers of enemies or when facing enemies with really high or increased Hit rates, like MVPs that have the skill "Power Up" (red lightning aura), Safety Wall spam is the way to go. As much as possible, going Steel Body must be avoided unless it is absolutely necessary, like in [[Tomb of the Fallen|Bio5]] or when fighting enemies with powerful magic spells like Nightmare Amon Ra's Meteor Storm spam and green aura Dracula and his overpowered Psychic Wave. If you die or if Steel Body expires, you can relog to regain the "Steel Body on death".

= Leveling =
'''This section is undergoing renovations.'''

While there is a general '''[[Leveling Guide]]''' available, this section will explain leveling a Super Novice from scratch, as if you just joined NovaRO and Super Novice is the first, or one of the first characters created.

=== &lt;u>Novice&lt;/u> ===
'''Lv1 - 180: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! (Work in progress)'''
* After completing [[Mom]]'s tutorial, go to Port Malaya (@go 34) and complete the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village]. Buy 6 {{Item List2|id=717|item=Blue Gemstone}} and 6 {{Item List2|id=523|item=Holy Water}} from the Tool Dealer Fruit, who is always nearby when warping to various towns. You will be above level 45, which is the minimum level required to become a Super Novice. Go to the [[Main Office]] @go 50, find the Job Changer and become a Super Novice.
** You may skip Mom's tutorial entirely and go straight to @go 34 if you wish.
* [[Orc/Goblin Village]]'s reputation quests make leveling significantly faster and easier until around level 180, due to the quests giving absolutely '''HYPER MASSIVE''' amounts of EXP for very little effort, the only road block being the 1 hour cooldown after turning in each quest. There are 3 quests in Orc Village and 3 in Goblin Village, each requiring killing a variety of Orcs and Goblins. Steam Goblins, Rotar Zairos and Orc Archers are not included.
* To easily access Orc/Goblin Village, talk the Warper NPC, select Dungeons and select Orc Dungeon. Exit the dungeon, go east and find a cute little Orc Hut at {{NewNaviLink|map=in_orcs01 106/177}} where you'll find an Orc Lord. Meanwhile, the Goblin King is in the field to the south, across the river bridge and to the right, chillin' on top of a tree house at {{NaviLink|map=gef_fild11|x=248|y=249}}. Click on the Navi links to copy them and paste it to the in-game chatbox by holding CTRL and pressing V '''(Ctrl + V)'''.
* If you're level 99 and below, turn in just one or two quests until you are Base Level 99 and Job Level 99, then upgrade to an Expanded Super Novice by talking to the Job Changer NPC in @go 50. Then turn in all the remaining quests and get all that sweet, sweet EXP.
&lt;br>
'''Lv1 - Lv26'''
Doing the starter quest after creating your character will increase your base level from 1 to 15. Be sure to check every nook and cranny of the tutorial area for useful equipment and consumables. Choose to get the {{Item List |id=30314 |item=Taekwon's Dobok|simple=yes}} so you can gain access to Warm Wind. After finishing the starter quest, go to the Criatura Academy in Izlude (@go 5) and register. Go upstairs, find the '''Taekwon classroom''', talk to the girl and get a {{Item List |id=2942 |item=Taekwon Manual |simple=yes}}. This is because the Taekwon Dobok will disappear once you become a Super Novice. Fight more monsters or do the rest of the Criatura Academy quests until you reach level 26.

'''Lv26 - Lv44'''
* '''Remember to type @autoloot or @autoloot 100'''. Mobs in Payon Dungeon is a decent source of early-game zeny, with Zombies dropping Opal (7% chance, 3000 zeny sell price) and Skeletons dropping Skull Ring (3% chance, 5000 zeny sell price)
* Go to Eden (@go 36 or @go eden), talk to Secretary Lime and register. Talk to Instructor Boya. Go to Payon Dungeon and exit. Talk to '''Eden Member Karl''' and he'll give you the quest to kill '''15 Skeletons''' followed by '''10 Poporings''' in Payon Dungeon. While doing his quests, kill everything you see.


=== &lt;u>Super Novice&lt;/u> ===

'''Lv45 - Lv70'''
*Once you reach base level 45, go to the Main Office, talk to the Job Master NPC and switch your job to Super Novice. Afterwards, kill a few more monsters in Payon Dungeon. Or you can go to Orc Dungeon and kill one '''Orc Zombie''' for an instant 20 job levels. Immediately get level 10 {{Skill List |id=48 |skill=Double Attack|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=26 |skill=Teleport|simple=yes}}, and put the rest into {{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Increase AGI|simple=yes}}.
* Proceed to Orc Dungeon. '''Kill everything you see'''. But watch out for '''Drainliar's''' Blind attack, '''Steel Chonchon's''' Silence and '''Orc Zombie's''' Crit attack. If you're going to the 2nd level of Orc Dungeon, watch out for '''Orc Archers''' - those things can easily kill you.
* Once you hit level 50+, go back to Eden and talk to Instructor Boya for a quest in Orc Dungeon.
* As you level up, start maxing {{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Increase AGI|simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=45 |skill=Attention Concentrate|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=49 |skill=Increase Dodge|simple=yes}}.

'''Lv71 - Lv84'''
* At this point, '''it is highly recommended to have at least 300 Flee''' (when buffed) to more easily evade attacks from Evil Druid and Wraith.
* Go back to Eden and talk to Instructor Ur to get a quest for Glast Heim St. Abbey. Grab the '''Wraith''' and '''Evil Druid''' kill quests (71-85 board). Go to Glast Heim St. Abbey (Warper > Dungeons > Glast Heim > St. Abbey). Kill '''Wraiths''' and '''Evil Druids'''. You'll need to be more cautious this time, as these things hit hard. Watch out for the occasional '''Mimic''' and '''Wraith Dead'''.
* After completing the quests, go back to Eden and grab your level 60 Eden Set.
* You may also do the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] quest to speed things up a bit.

'''Lv85 - Lv99'''
* At this point, '''it is highly recommended to have at least 340 Flee''' (when buffed) to more easily evade attacks from most mobs in Gramps.
* Go to Eden and do the Gramps quest. The board and the cranky Gramps NPC are at the upper left side. The Gramps board quests consist of killing 400 of two kinds of monsters and has a 4-hour cooldown. Finishing this will give massive amounts of EXP. Inside each Gramps Field are the two monsters on the board plus 2-3 other kinds. The monsters on the board rotate each month, then the other 2-3 will usually remain the same.
* '''Stay inside Gramps until you've reached Job Level 99'''. Go back to the Main Office, talk to the Job Changer NPC and upgrade to an Ex. Super Novice, then turn in both quests.

=== &lt;u>Expanded Super Novice&lt;/u> ===
'''This section is undergoing renovations.'''

'''Lv100-114'''
* Keep doing the 85-114 Gramps quests. When the Gramps quests are on cooldown, you can do Reno's Pure Energy Crystal quests (preferably '''Raydric''') and [[Eden Group]] quests. Eden Group quests give {{Item List2 |id=25223 |item=Paradise Coin}} which can be traded for Awakened Paradise Equipment, which can be enchanted.
* 
* [[Banquet for Heroes]], [[Terra Gloria]] and [[Illusion]] become available. Doing the quest chain of these three gives a good amount of experience and is a viable alternative to Gramps.

'''Lv115 - Lv120'''
* At this point, it is recommended to have at least 400 Flee (when buffed).
* Gramps will be the best way to go from level 115-144, as you'll most likely have a bit of difficulty killing monsters and soloing dungeons. When Gramps is on cooldown, you can continue to do Reno's Pure Energy Crystal quests, Eden Group quests and dailies from Banquet for Hereoes, Terra Gloria and Illusion.

'''Level 120-144'''
* Starting from here, more instances will be available for you to join as you level up. When Gramps is on cooldown, aside from the usual Reno Pure Crystal quests and Eden board quests, you can start joining [[Instances]]. Except for [[Ghost Palace]] (solo instances), it is recommended to join a party.
* At level 140, [[Phantasmagorica]] quests become available. They'll give access to the [[Last Room]] and [[Central Laboratory]] instances and the [[Verus Dailies]].

'''Lv145 - Lv175'''
* Again, Gramps will be the best way to go, as killing monsters at these levels can get long, tedious and difficult. Try to loot the Bookclip of Memory that '''Antique Book''' drops, as they're mats for the [[Custom Headgear Quests|Rideword Hat Quest]] and the Eden gathering quest.
* When Gramps is on cooldown, again, you may continue to do [[Instances]], Reno's Pure Energy Crystal quests, Eden board quests and the aforementioned Banquet for Heroes, Terra Gloria daily quests.
* At level 150, Illusion of Abyss becomes accessible. It is a good place to level up. Bring Green Potions if the Ominous Permeters' Hallucation is too annoying.
* At level 160, Illusion of Luanda and Illusion of Twins become accessible. Both are good places to level up, but Illusion of Twins is usually the better choice because it has some valuable drops and gives way more EXP overall.

'''Lv175-200'''
* This is the toughest stretch before becoming a Hyper Novice. Hang in there!
* There are two main ways to level: '''Gramps 175-200''' and '''Thanatos Tower 12.''' Thana12 requires at least level 180. It is highly recommended to bring Blue Potions and Guyak Pudding due to the fat chibi monsters frequently spamming Level 11 Decrease AGI and SP leech. Full Chemical Protection is recommended due to the mobs breaking armors and weapons.
* If Gramps 175-200 and Thanatos Tower 12 are too difficult or are on cooldown, '''Illusion of Twins''' and '''Illusion of Labyrinth''' are also good places to level, especially the former. In Illusion of Twins, there is an NPC, Seshin, who gives EXP after killing 100 monsters. Get all the unique drops here in case any Illusion equipment from here is needed.

=== &lt;u>Hyper Novice&lt;/u> ===

'''200-215 '''
*[[Illusion of Labyrinth]] - Tons of mobs and fixed EXP means tons of EXP until around level 220. Also a decent place to earn some zeny along the way if you're looting everything.
*[[Illusion of Underwater]] 2 - Bring Coldproof potions. Beware the &lt;s>Jellymon&lt;/s> Deep Sea Sedora and their unusually overpowered Storm Gust and Water Ball. It is highly recommended to do the Illusion Quests for this and Illusion of Labyrinth for equipment refinement boxes. Good until around level 220.
*[[Ancient Juperos]] - Lots of mobs. Ancient Juperos 2 may be slightly easier due to the lack of ranged mobs, unlike Ancient Juperos 1's Dimiks.
*[[Niflheim Dungeon]] 1 - Nif1 has TONS of mobs in a relatively small space, making it a great place to level up, earn zeny and grab Etel Dusts. Watch out for Stone Curse and SP Leech by &lt;s>Rubik's&lt;/s> Ghost Cube.
*[[Rudus 4]] - Not as crowded as Nif1 mob and player wise, making it a good alternate leveling spot if Nif1 and Thana12 are way too crowded. Watch out for Giant Caput's Spiral Pierce, which may instantly kill.

'''200-240 (Alternate leveling)'''
*[[Thanatos Tower]] 12 - In Thana12, Guyak Pudding and Blue Potions are recommended due to the neverending barrage of Level 11 Decrease AGI and SP Leech from the fat chibi Horror of Thanatos. In addition, have a Genetic provide Full Chemical Protection due to some of the mobs breaking armors and weapons. There are lots of EXP from the boss-protocol monsters and a decent amount of zeny earned per hour (around 10M maybe?) when autolooting everything. Fragment of Despair can be used to make Ace's Hat of Flames.

'''215-230'''
*[[Amicitia Dungeon]] 1 - Get ready to be knocked around a lot due to the mobs spamming Jupitel Thunder and Storm Gust like they're going out of style. Highly recommended to use Shining DEF scroll here to prevent getting Frozen by Vanilaqus, the blue amorphous blob homunculus.

'''230-240'''
*Amacitia Dungeon 2 - Full Chemical Protection is needed due to Lava Eater's tendency to break armors, but Safety Wall should help deal with that problem to a certain extent. Shining DEF scrolls are also recommended due to the horses frequently casting Storm Gust and causing Frozen.

'''230+ (Alternate leveling)'''
*Airship Crash - Except for the Mosquitoes, all mobs move very slowly and can be easily kited with ranged attacks. For melee builds, Safety Wall is advised when fighting Melted Poring due to Strip Shadow Gear. Shadow or Undead element armors are recommended when fighting Rotten Tree because of Dark Grand Cross.

'''240+'''
*Niflheim Dungeon 2 - Nif2 is a relatively mobby place but is manageable for the most part. It is one of, if not the fastest way to level up from 240 and above, especially with a 12-man party with Kim (Troubador with Mr. Kim's a Rich Man). For Physical Hyper Novices, watch out for the Loli's Lex Divina, which can cause Silence even with 100 INT. Also watch out for the occasional Brandish Spear, which may result in an instant kill.
*Ancient Factory - Mobs have at least 14M HP, ridiculously high HIT (up to 979), hit just as hard as truck-kun and gives less EXP than Nif2. '''Shining Defense Scroll is highly recommended!''' It is best to have enough ATK or MATK to dispose of them in just 1 strike before they strike back or else they'll hit with really painful skills like Dragon Breath. If killing them in 1 hit isn't possible, either use Level 10 Safety Wall for extra protection especially when facing lots of them, or use hit-and-run tactics, preferably with Cart Boost, which Super Novices can use if they have a Racing Cap (Super Novice) with a Racing (Super Novice) Lv2 enchant.
