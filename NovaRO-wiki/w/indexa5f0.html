I have been playing RO for years now, hopping from server to server. Soul Linker (SL) was one of my favorite classes to main back in the pre-renewal days and after playing in renewal for few years, I was super excited when Soul Reaper (SR) was announced and was finally coming. I love the theme and aesthetics of Soul Linker/Reaper, not to mention they compliment my preference on playing support classes (minus the fact they can also deal okay-ish damage). Without further ado, let's get the guide started.

&lt;div style="float:left;">__TOC__&lt;/div>

== Preface ==
'''Why play Soul Reaper?'''&lt;br>
Soul Reaper, often called as '''SR''', provides your team with buffs like none others. Their gimmick skills makes them a valuable support and their versatility to deal with different kind of elements proves them as a potential DPS. SRs are also naturally "tanky" in a way because of how their skills interact with each another, which is also another solid point to be proud of.&lt;br>&lt;br>
'''Is Soul Reaper newbie-friendly?'''&lt;br>
They are not necessarily newbie-friendly, no. Their skills are not simple like '''Arch Bishops''' or '''Minstrels''', and they require good gears to function as a consistent DPS. Though if you really like playing Soul Reapers, they can do just fine even for newbies and or new players.&lt;br>&lt;br>
'''Is Soul Reaper viable end-game?'''&lt;br>
Yes, very much yes. People severely underrate the capabilities of SR, and while this hurts SR players one way or another, SR is still pretty much a viable class for end-game content.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
With those being said, Soul Reaper definitely has their own pros and cons as listed below:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: auto; width: 50%"
! style="background-color:#3CB371; color:white; width: 25%" | Pros
! style="background-color:#800000; color:white; width: 25%" | Cons
|-
|
* High sustain
* Naturally immune to {{Skill List |id=289 |skill=Dispell}}
* Versatile magic attacks
* Unique supporting skills
* Good solo potential
* Affordable (Support)
|
* Abysmal HP pool
* Sub-par crowd control
* Expensive (DPS)
* Complicated
* Underrated (explanation below)
|}
&lt;br>
For the last point in the cons, being underrated matters when it comes to recruitment in random parties. Soul Reapers do not have the highest DPS nor the most important skills as a support, but they are just different in their own way. The fact that you need {{Skill List|id=461|skill=Soul Linker Spirit}} (by having another Soul Reaper/Linker in the party) to unlock your full supporting potential hurts them because of their unpopularity, you are less likely to achieve your full supporting capabilities.

=== Stats ===
Soul Reaper is a caster by nature, so their stat builds don't really differ from one build to another &lt;s>unless you are playing meme {{Item List|id=28745|item=Illusion Counter Dagger}} build&lt;/s>. Here is the stats priority for Soul Reaper, with highlighted stats being more important than the others:&lt;br>
{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
! style="background-color:#ADD8E6; width: 15% "|Stats
! style="background-color:#ADD8E6; width: 15% "|Priority
! style="background-color:#ADD8E6; width: 70% "|Notes
|-
|&lt;center>Strength (STR)&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>Low&lt;/center>
|Soul Reapers use STR for:
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Weight_Limit Carrying capacity (weight)]'''
The only use for this stats is for weight limit as a Soul Reaper, as ATK does almost nothing (unless you are playing the meme build I mentioned above). Soul Reaper does not use catalyst like other classes, so you only '''really''' want this when you carry heavy stuff &lt;s>especially your random teammates on instance runs&lt;/s>.
|-
|&lt;center>Agility (AGI)&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>Medium - High&lt;/center>
|Soul Reapers use AGI for:
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/ASPD Attack speed (ASPD)]'''
Having high attack speed allows you to chain your skills more efficiently, which is especially important if you are being a DPS Soul Reaper. Depending on your gears, you can shave off some agility from your base stats.
|-
|&lt;center>Vitality (VIT)&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>High&lt;/center>
|Soul Reapers use VIT for:
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Max_HP HP]''' and '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/HP_Recovery HP regen]'''
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/DDEF#Soft_DEF Soft DEF]''' and '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/MDEF#Soft_MDEF Soft MDEF]'''
Never a bad stats to get for any class as it boosts your HP, especially as Soul Reaper because your base HP pool is awful.
|-
|&lt;center>Intelligence (INT)&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>High&lt;/center>
|Soul Reapers use INT for:
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/MATK#Status_MATK Status MATK]'''
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Max_SP SP] and [https://irowiki.org/wiki/SP_Recovery SP regen]'''
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#Cast_Time Cast time reduction]'''
Soul Reaper SP usage is pretty crazy, not to mention this stats also boosts your cast time which is all around useful. Also useful to boost MATK for DPS build
|-
|&lt;center>Dexterity (DEX)&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>Low - High&lt;/center>
|Soul Reapers use DEX for:
* '''Attack speed'''
* '''Cast time reduction'''
This stat reduces cast time twice as effective as INT does and attack speed less than AGI. Depending on your gears, you either want this stats or none at all
|-
|&lt;center>Luck (LUK)&lt;/center>
|&lt;center>Medium&lt;/center>
|Soul Reapers use LUK for:
* '''MATK'''
* '''[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Curse Curse] resist'''
Usually regarded as a "leftover" stats, but considering how {{Skill List|id=2605|skill=Soul Unity}} works, you will want to be curse immune and one of the way to get it is via LUK. It also gives nice stats like MATK and Perfect Dodge, which is good on any Soul Reaper build.
|-

The freedom is yours to setup your own stat build; it is not set in stone since stat build varies heavily depending on your equipment and also your build.

== Skill Build ==

Here is the breakdown of skills and what to get, all the way from the bottom, starting from '''Taekwon''':

=== Taekwon ===

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
! style="background-color:#ffcccb" colspan="4" | Taekwon Skills
|-
! style=" width: 25% "| Skill
! style=" width: 10% "| Skill Type
! style=" width: 60% "| Notes
! style=" width: 10% "| Recommended Level
|-
|{{Skill List |id=411 |skill=Sprint}}
|&lt;center>Toggle&lt;/center>
|One of your mobility tool. The usage of '''Spurt''' also helps you to level up from Taekwon super fast.
|&lt;center>7-10&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=420 |skill=Tumbling}}
|&lt;center>Toggle&lt;/center>
|Gives you extra survivability from ranged and magic attacks. Always good to have.
|&lt;center>1&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=421 |skill=Flying Side Kicks}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Often referred as '''FSK''', this is your primary leveling skill as Taekwon, and also a pre-requisite for {{Skill List |id=420 |skill=Tumbling}}, so take it!
|&lt;center>7&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=422 |skill=Peaceful Break}}
|&lt;center>Passive&lt;/center>
|Pre-requisite for {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}} so you gotta take it. Otherwise it does not have much use these days.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=423 |skill=Happy Break}}
|&lt;center>Passive&lt;/center>
|Now unlike Peaceful Break, you will want to maximize this as DPS SR since {{Item List2 |id=24315 |item=Taekwon Shadow Shield | slots=1}} gives you 3% MDEF pierce per level. Unless you are opting for the support build, then you can just dump your excess skill point here.
|&lt;center>5-10&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=424 |skill= Kihop}}
|&lt;center>Passive&lt;/center>
|Useless for SR except for {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}} pre-requisite. Nothing else to add.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Imagine having the power to manipulate '''7 elements''' on your magic attacks! This skill basically does it, which makes it a must get for DPS SR build. It's not like you have any other skill points to spend on as Support build, either.
|&lt;center>7&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=426 |skill= High Jump}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Yeets yourself forward, very good mobility skill if you know how to use it. It's basically {{Skill List |id=150 |skill= Back Slide}} but forward and farther.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=413 |skill= Literally}} {{Skill List |id=415 |skill= other}} {{Skill List |id=417 |skill= kicks}} {{Skill List |id=419 |skill= and}} {{Skill List |id=493 |skill= this}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Do me a favor and don't take them, '''at all'''. You can't use them as SR and leveling as Taekwon is super easy with Spurt + Warm Wind + FSK.
|&lt;center>'''NO'''&lt;/center>
|}
* You get '''Spurt''' buff by re-activating {{Skill List |id=411 |skill=Sprint}} again while using it. Also you need to be wearing no weapon to get it.
* Using {{Skill List |id=421 |skill=Flying Side Kicks}} while on {{Skill List |id=411 |skill=Sprint}} increases its damage. All the more if you have Spurt buff active.
* You can use /bingbing /bangbang command to control your {{Skill List |id=426 |skill= High Jump}} direction, similar to how good GXes use {{Skill List |id=150 |skill= Back Slide}}.

=== Soul Linker ===

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
! style="background-color:#FF7F50" colspan="4" | Soul Linker Skills
|-
! style=" width: 25% "| Skill
! style=" width: 10% "| Skill Type
! style=" width: 60% "| Notes
! style=" width: 10% "| Recommended Level
|-
|{{Skill List |id=462 |skill=Kaizel}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Super important to have as it virtually makes you unkillable. Imagine having unlimited amount of {{Item List2 |id=7621 |item=Token of Siegfried}}, this skill is basically that &lt;s>unless you forget to recast it after reviving&lt;/s>. You can also give this to your party members if you have {{Skill List |id=461 |skill=Soul Linker Spirit}} active.
|&lt;center>7&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|{{Skill List |id=157 |skill=Energy Coat}} but instead of reducing damage, it heals you. Important to have since it increases your sustain by '''A LOT'''. Granted, there's a huge drawback early on when using it as it drains your SP like mad. It gets better later on though so really no reason not to take it.
|&lt;center>7&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=464 |skill=Kaupe}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|A solid skill to give you a breather. Evaded attacks via this also procs {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} heal, so it is useful when you are trying to heal yourself back up.
|&lt;center>3&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=466 |skill=Kaina}}
|&lt;center>Passive&lt;/center>
|Increases your max SP which isn't bad, but just level it up if you have spare skill points to spend.
|&lt;center>Leftover&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=470 |skill=Eswoo}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Mini me as a skill! It helps you to single out troublesome enemies, makes you an excellent 1v1 combatant in PvM scenario. Good to take as both Support and DPS build.
|&lt;center>7&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=472 |skill=Eska}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Cuts down the target's ASPD significantly while giving them tiny bit of resist. Same like {{Skill List |id=470 |skill=Eswoo}}, it makes your 1v1 scenario in PvM much more manageable.
|&lt;center>3&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=467 |skill=Estin,}} {{Skill List |id=468 |skill=Estun, and}} {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Your primary leveling tool if you decide to pursue the solo path. {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} element is endowable by {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}} which is a huge plus compared to Mages' bolt skills. You need to chain them since it is {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} requirement, so it goes like:&lt;br>
{{Skill List |id=467 |skill=Estin}} into {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} or...&lt;br>
{{Skill List |id=468 |skill=Estun}} into  {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}}&lt;br>
Though personally speaking, {{Skill List |id=467 |skill=Estin}} is used more for the '''knockback''' aspect while {{Skill List |id=468 |skill=Estun}} for the '''damage'''. I leave it to you while leveling to make the correct call. For '''Support''' builds, it is important to have at least 1 level of {{Skill List |id=467 |skill=Estin}} for the knockback aspect of it.

|Not gonna lie, I am not gonna explain every single function of Soul Links. I am just gonna put down the important ones you '''SHOULD''' (not must) take and their respective effects:
*{{Skill List |id=445 |skill=Alchemist Spirit}}: Enables the usage of various brewing skills and {{Skill List |id=446 |skill=Berserk Pitcher}}. Also increases their {{Skill List |id=231 |skill=Potion Pitcher}} heal. &lt;s>Time for some heal Alche memes with {{Item List2 |id=24259 |item=Alchemist Shadow Shoes}}&lt;/s>&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=448 |skill=Star Gladiator Spirit}}: Allows them to use {{Skill List |id=444 |skill=Union}} which is nice, but has a huge drawback. '''ALWAYS''' ask your '''Star Emperor''' or '''Star Gladiator''' if they want to be linked or not.&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=451 |skill=Super Novice Spirit}}: Allows them to equip gears they normally could not due to class restrictions.&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=455 |skill=Bard and Dancer Spirits}}: Enable them to use their counterpart songs or dances.&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=456 |skill=Rogue Spirit}}: Makes their buffs not removed by {{Skill List |id=289 |skill=Dispell}}, including {{Skill List |id=475 |skill=Preserve}}. Also increases the effectiveness of potions made by top Alchemist players (use /alchemist to check in-game).&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=458 |skill=Blacksmith Spirit}}: Allows the usage of {{Skill List |id=459 |skill=Full Adrenaline Rush}} which can be handy in certain setup.&lt;br>
*{{Skill List |id=461 |skill=Soul Linker Spirit}}: This skill is like your biggest enabler. Allows you to use Ka- skills ({{Skill List |id=464 |skill=Kaupe}}, {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}}, and {{Skill List |id=462 |skill=Kaizel}}) on other people freely, which can be gamechanging in a lot of situations.

|{{Skill List |id=471 |skill=Eske}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|The trade off from this skill is simply not worth in my opinion. You use magic most of the time in PvM and as a support, you don't really want to amp a monster's damage by 300%. &lt;s>Similar to {{Skill List |id=465 |skill=Kaite}} though, you can take this skill for self-made suffering.

* Ka- based skills can only be casted on '''players''', while Es- based skills can only be casted on '''monsters'''.
* Without {{Skill List |id=461 |skill=Soul Linker Spirit}}, you can still cast Ka- based skills on yourself, your spouse and child (via [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Marriage_System marriage]), and other Soul Linkers/Reapers.
* Soul Linker's soul links '''do not stack''' with Soul Reaper soul buffs.

|{{Skill List |id=2609 |skill=Soul Collect}}
|&lt;center>Toggle&lt;/center>
|One of your first ways to get souls to use Soul Reaper skills. Though, you don't want to rely on it when collecting souls since it takes a long time even at max level to reach the cap. Regardless, having it toggled on is always nice and can fasten your leveling early on.
|&lt;center>1 or 5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Your primary tool to farm souls. '''ANY''' kind of damage you do gives a % to give you soul and allows you to hit cap much faster, allowing you to spam your skills much more freely. Definitely a must get even as a support.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2611 |skill=Soul Energy Research}}
|&lt;center>Passive&lt;/center>
|Increase the cap of your souls. Not too important to level early on, but you need to max it out eventually.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2605 |skill=Soul Unity}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Since you need 10 souls to cast this, having at least 2 levels of {{Skill List |id=2611 |skill=Soul Energy Research}} is necessary. This skill passively restores HP every 3 seconds on affected targets and allow you to cast {{Skill List |id=2612 |skill=Kaute}} on them. Also you need to be immune from [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Curse Curse] and [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Silence Silence] to get the max value out of this.
|&lt;center>5 or 7&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2612 |skill=Kaute}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|I can't stress on how good this skill is. This skill compliments with {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} so well that it solves your major SP problems as Soul Linker. As a DPS too you can get back the souls you spend using this thanks to {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}}. It also gives you a pretty nice utility on some parties when paired with {{Skill List |id=2605 |skill=Soul Unity}} since you can keep restoring SP on other party members while regenerating your lost HP back. All in all, very good skill to have.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>

|{{Skill List |id=2599 |skill=Fairy Soul}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Aside from the MATK it provides, the -10% Variable Cast Time (VCT) reduction can really help builds focused on stacking variable cast time reduction.
|&lt;center>5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2608 |skill=Soul Revolve}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Poorman's way to restore SP &lt;i>on your party members&lt;/i>. You literally gain no SP using this on yourself and its scaling is pretty horrible. Aside from restoring SP, you can also cycle souls between other party members in case of misclick or when you are trying to coordinate some stuff like:
*Give {{Skill List |id=461 |skill=Soul Linker Spirit}} on other SL/SR so they can Ka- buff your party, {{Skill List |id=2608 |skill=Soul Revolve}} to remove their spirit after buffing and give them {{Skill List |id=2596 |skill=Golem Soul}} to make them tankier.
*Go full DPS with {{Skill List |id=2599 |skill=Fairy Soul}} on yourself, then switch to {{Skill List |id=2596 |skill=Golem Soul}} using {{Skill List |id=2608 |skill=Soul Revolve}} if the mob is attacking you.

... and many more.&lt;br>
And yes, you cannot stack Soul Reaper's soul skills with Soul Linker's soul links (gravity why).
|&lt;center>2&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2603 |skill=Esha}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|Despite its low MATK, it gives decent utility on slowing group of enemies together. Leveling it up increases its duration which is kinda nice if you plan on utilizing it a lot
|&lt;center>1 or 5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2601 |skill=Curse of Wicked Souls}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|If you are asking if 100% (20% on bosses) more damage from Shadow attacks is good or not, well this skill answers that for you. Opens up more possibilities in your party setup as long as you are not fighting Shadow or Undead mobs. Similar to {{Skill List |id=2021 |skill=Venom Impress}} and {{Skill List |id=2046 |skill=Oratio}}, it can be a good utility skill to boost your overall DPS. 
|&lt;center>1 or 5&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|You wish {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} deals more damage and does not need you to cast other skills beforehand? Well, meet this. It deals way more damage, has no Aftercast Delay (ACD), and has insane spam rate with max attackspeed plus instant cast. The biggest problem however, is the '''HUGE''' Fixed Cast Time (FCT) it has with limited ways to remove it. Though once you get your gears, this skill is hands down your main source of damage as a DPS SR.&lt;br>
And yes, this skill is endowable with {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}}.
|&lt;center>10&lt;/center>
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2604 |skill=Eswhoo}}
|&lt;center>Active&lt;/center>
|AoE {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}}, what else can I say. Though like {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}}, you need to cast {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}} beforehand to use this skill, so it is not that optimal as a crowd control measurement.&lt;br>
Likewise, this skill is endowable via {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}}.

|-
|{{Skill List |id=2600 |skill=Curse Explosion}}

* {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}} is not dispelled on death, but always keep an eye out for your buff timer since it has the same cooldown as its duration.
* You keep your souls even if you log out.
* Soul Reaper soul buffs '''do not stack''' with Soul Linker soul links.
* You can cast soul buffs on yourself unlike soul links.


== Leveling Gameplay &amp; Equipment ==
You can refer to [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Leveling_Guide NovaRO Leveling Guide] on where to level up. This section is created to give specific tips for '''Taekwon''' up until '''Soul Reaper''' during leveling.&lt;br>
Some general tips also include:&lt;br>
* Every time your base level increases, you restore 100% HP and SP. In addition to this, Taekwon class gets free {{Skill List |id=34 |skill=Level 10 Blessing}} and {{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Level 10 Inc. Agi}} for 10 minutes
* Reminder to have @autoloot on so you aren't poor as you level up
* I also recommend you to do some [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Board_Quests Board Quests] '''past level 100''' in Eden, especially the ones that overlap with your [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Leveling_Guide#Gramps Gramps]. Doing them gives you {{Item List2 |item=Paradise Coin |id=25223}} which you can use to purchase higher level Eden Equipment.
* Taekwon class '''does not rebirth'''. So just go ham and get all the exp you can instead of saving quests.&lt;br>

|
* Level up your {{Skill List |id=411 |skill=Sprint}}! '''Spurt''' is a huge damage booster and only available from level 7 onwards. This is because you want to pump up '''DEX''' and '''INT''' as a Soul Linker/Reaper. Granted, there is a Reset NPC but pumping STR as a Taekwon soon-to-be Linker is not necessary early on.
* {{Skill List |id=421 |skill=Flying Side Kick}} is your best friend while leveling. You need to practice '''Spurt + Sprint + FSK''' combo to deal insanely high damage.
* '''ALWAYS''' pre-cast {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}} and {{Skill List |id=411 |skill=Sprint}} (for Spurt) in town! Your SP pool is abysmal so having free SP restoration ('''Healer''' NPC) is nice before you warp to dungeons. Later on inside dungeons, manage your SP properly so you don't run out before leveling up
* You can start doing Eden Equipment Quests from level 12, but I '''highly recommend''' you to do the one on level 26-32 '''AND/OR''' 50-59 range. Every other one takes too long for the effort.&lt;br>

Here's the list of equipment you '''should''' consider as a Taekwon:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: justify; margin: auto; width: 60%"

|Just starting out with RO? Worry not, Eden Set is more than enough to help you level up. They get the job done and doesn't cost you a single peny.
|-
|&lt;center>'''Others'''&lt;/center>
|If this is not your first char, you can transfer your gears and use some pretty good higher-tier equips like {{Item List2 |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin |slots=1}} and {{Item List2 |id=32368 |item=Cursed Knight's Shield |slots=1}} including its other variations. Those are some equipment I can think on top of my head, but there are definitely more of high-tier equip that you can wear at low level to fasten up your leveling.

* I '''highly recommend''' you to do Ur's Equipment Quest once you are in '''level 70 - 79'''. Every other Equipment Quest simply takes too long.
* You can do [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] quest to get some job level going since SL cannot use FSK and therefore, lack offensive capabilities early on.
* If you turn in '''Boya's Equipment Quest''' from level 50-59 as '''Soul Linker''', you will get {{Item List |id=13051 |item=Eden Dagger II}} that can help you out if you don't want to buy a weapon from NPC. Otherwise, you can consider buying an {{Item List |id=1610 |item=Arc Wand |slots=1}} to help you out.
'''Support Gameplay'''
* Unlike Priests that can get away by healing undeads to level up, you need to level up your offensive skills if you decide to solo as a support Linker. It is advised to get a consistent party while leveling up a full support Linker
* You don't necessarily need a weapon as a support Linker in the meantime. Having '''Spurt''' status active while  you are in {{Skill List |id=420 |skill=Tumbling}} gives you access to dodge every kind of attacks instead of just ranged ones.
* Use {{Skill List |id=470 |skill=Eswoo}} to slow down fast-moving enemies and {{Skill List |id=472 |skill=Eska}} to slow down fast-attacking enemies. This way you can mitigate the damage taken by yourself and your party
* '''Always''' have {{Skill List |id=462 |skill=Kaizel}} active on yourself '''at all times'''. Be sure to cast it on other people too (either granted via {{Skill List |id=461 |skill=Soul Linker Spirit}} or marriage)
* '''Do not always''' use {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Level 7 Kaahi}}. Observe the amount of damage you or your party members take and use the appropriate level accordingly. If you are getting hit for less than 500 damage per hit, then use level 3 max, and so on.
* If you are partying with certain classes with good soul links effect (refer to my skill table above), try to maximize that soul link level as soon as possible. It costs '''460 SP''' at level 1 and '''60 SP''' at level 5 which makes a huge difference at this level. It also lasts shorter at level 1, which makes you spend even more SP unnecessarily.
* In Gramps parties, Linker makes a good lurer thanks to {{Skill List |id=426 |skill=High Jump}}, {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}}, and {{Skill List |id=462 |skill=Kaizel}}. This makes you almost an unkillable lurer with high mobility. Watch out for the SP usage though!
&lt;br>
'''DPS Gameplay'''
* Remember to study your enemies' element (either by website or @mi command in-game) to maximize {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} damage when endowed with {{Skill List |id=425 |skill=Warm Wind}}
* Remember you can also use {{Skill List |id=470 |skill=Eswoo}} against fast moving enemies to delay them, that way you can execute your {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} combo.
* Other tips on '''Support Gameplay''' is also applicable here to a different extent.&lt;br>

|&lt;center>'''Morpheus' Set'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Morpheus' Hood |id=5126}}&lt;br>{{Item List2 |item=Morpheus' Shawl |id=2518}}&lt;br>{{Item List2 |item=Morpheus' Ring |id=2648}}&lt;br>{{Item List2 |item=Morpheus' Bracelet |id=2649}}
|Gives tons of SP and INT, and also uninterruptable casting time. If you happen to have this laying around somewhere, time to put it on a good use. '''Note that this is more of a luxury for newer players and you shouldn't worry too much if you can't get it'''.
|-
|&lt;center>'''Goibne's Set'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Goibne's Helm |id=5128}}&lt;br>{{Item List2 |item=Goibne's Armor |id=2354}}&lt;br>{{Item List2 |item=Goibne's Spaulders |id=2520}}&lt;br>{{Item List2 |item=Goibne's Greaves |id=2419}}

|With this pair, you can regain 3 SP per melee attacks you receive due to reflect. This can offset the SP consumption of {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} a little bit and thus, making your SP lasts much longer. Moonlight Dagger also gives +10% max SP, so it's not a bad idea to get it early
|-
|&lt;center>'''Others'''&lt;/center>
|Got spare equipment from other characters? At level 70, you can start using {{Item List2 |item=Crimson Rod |slots=2 |id=1680}}, especially if a high-refined one. Others also include {{Item List2 |item=Spell Circuit (GC) |slots=1 |id=19249}} or {{Item List2 |item=Spell Circuit (EVT) |slots=1 |id=32385}} and {{Item List2 |item=Magic Intensifier Ring |slots=1 |id=2964}} to further boost your MATK.

|This section is directed mainly for leveling Soul Reapers. If you are looking for end-game equipment info, see '''Equipment''' section below.&lt;br>
'''General Gameplay'''
* Get {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}} as soon as possible as you harvest souls better with this instead of {{Skill List |id=2609 |skill=Soul Collect}}.
* Have {{Skill List |id=2609 |skill=Soul Collect}} active regardless since it is a passive soul generation without drawback.
* Have {{Item List |id=4569 |item=(Bio 4) Chen Card}} on a spare garment for swap! This is super important to have regardless of your gameplay.
* Maximize {{Skill List |id=2611 |skill=Soul Energy Research}} if you plan on using a lot of soul-related skills so you don't run out of souls easily due to the higher cap.&lt;br>
'''Support Gameplay'''
* {{Skill List |id=2605 |skill=Soul Unity}} is more ideally used where your party doesn't split up too much / when you are soloing. Despite its fairly decent effect, it is easily dispelled due to various aspects. Not to mention it costs 10 souls to cast and has lengthy cooldown.
* Unlike Soul Linker links, you can use Soul Reaper soul buffs on yourself. Also don't forget to keep your entire party buffed with soul buffs. Support classes like '''Arch Bishops''' would prefer {{Skill List |id=2596 |skill=Golem Soul}} in majority of cases, magical DPS classes like '''Warlocks''' would prefer {{Skill List |id=2599 |skill=Fairy Soul}}, etc.
* Although {{Skill List |id=2612 |skill=Kaute}} restores a lot of SP to people, its requirement is rather complex when used on teammates. Using {{Skill List |id=2608 |skill=Soul Revolve}} can be a good alternative to restore your teammates SP.
* {{Skill List |id=2603 |skill=Esha}} is a very good tool to slow down a group of enemies. You don't have to worry about spending 1 soul to use it either if you have {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}} active.
* {{Skill List |id=2601 |skill=Curse of Wicked Souls}} can be used when fighting mobs with no significant element weakness. Combined with physical DPS who can use  {{Item List2 |id=12020 |item=Cursed Water}}, it can deal massive damage.&lt;br>
'''DPS Gameplay'''
* {{Skill List |id=469 |skill=Esma}} is still usable at this point because {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}} has a pretty long Fixed Cast Time and consumes souls per use before level 10. Consider asking for {{Skill List |id=2515 |skill=Sacrament}} if you have an '''Arch Bishop''' with you.
* {{Skill List |id=2604 |skill=Eswhoo}} is your only AoE-damaging skill and you need to cast {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}} beforehand. Be mindful when trying to clear a group of mobs as this skill has a CD.
* {{Skill List |id=425 |skill=Warm Wind}} endows your two offensive skills above, always remember to study your enemies first!
* Other tips on '''Support Gameplay''' is also applicable here to a different extent.&lt;br>

|Obtainable from [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Airship_Assault Airship Assault] instance. This one is '''easier''' to get than other sets mentioned before but has '''less''' potential than them. Though regardless, grab one if you can since it is way easier to afford and farm.

|Reducing your Fixed Cast Time is important because of skills like {{Skill List |id=462 |skill=Kaizel}} and {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}}, though mostly Espa. Fixed Cast Time gatekeeps SR DPS until they can eliminate it, and these two are just two of the most "affordable" options to reduce it. They are obtained from different sources, {{Item List2 |id=22004 |item=Temporal DEX Boots}} and its slotted version from [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim] instance, while Illusion related equipment is obtained from episodic content, [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Illusion Illusion]. I suggest you to buy them from players instead as making them is pretty difficult for newer players.

|A good investment if you are planning to transition into DPS SR, the entire Illusion set itself is pretty affordable and does excellent job at boosting your DPS. Though obviously, they are much better at higher refine. Do not be afraid of using them non-enchanted at +4 though, since they still provide excellent bonuses.

|&lt;center>'''Others'''&lt;/center>
|For Soul Reaper '''Others''' gears, please refer to the '''Equipment''' section below as I will be discussing the end-game equipment.
|}
|}

== Equipment ==
This section is dedicated for Soul Reapers with high level and or wish to gear for end-game content. The gears listed will be divided based on their function and build, such as '''VCTR Equipment''' (Variable Cast Time Reduction), '''Defensive Equipment''', and so on. Some equipment can also '''overlap''' on different categories. Keep in mind you can still mix the equipment from different categories to suit your needs.&lt;br>

=== VCTR Equipment ===
'''Why do I need VCTR gears?'''&lt;br>
It allows you to build near, if not, instant cast SR with minimum DEX. Consider this when you want to pool your stat points elsewhere since SR is one of '''Expanded Classes''', meaning they don't rebirth and thus having less stat points to spend. {{Skill List |id=462 |skill=Kaizel}} is also one of few skills that can '''only''' be reduced via VCTR gears so it has some general uses.&lt;br>

|&lt;center>Lower + Garment&lt;/center>
|The more expensive version of '''Poison Breath + GSS Combo'''. This combo also gives you decent '''ASPD''' and '''MATK''' on top of the 32% VCTR (120 base INT), which is more suitable for '''DPS SR'''.&lt;br>

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=28426 |item=Mercenary Ring Type B}}

|There are a lot of equipment that gives Spell enchants to list above, so I compile them at here instead. Aside from giving VCTR, Spell also gives MATK which is useful for '''DPS SR'''. Some of usable equipment with Spell enchants for SR, but not limited to, are:

|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|Gives 1% VCTR per refinement level and 2% MATK at +9. Recommended to be put on '''Upper''' slot because it can be refined.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4229 |item=Tower Keeper Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|5% flat VCTR and +1 INT, good for budget option or middle headgear.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4169 |item=Dark Illusion Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|Not a big fan of this due to its drawback, but it's an option and gives the highest VCTR with least effort.

=== Defensive Equipment ===
'''Why do I need to have Defensive Equipment?'''&lt;br>
End-game mobs have skills that easily bypass your heal from {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} or outdamages it. The heal from it is also '''fixed''' healing (not reduced or amplified by any source). Stacking enough resist lowers the damage received and makes its healing much more effective.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
'''What should I be looking for in this section?'''&lt;br>
There are different kind of things that you can get to increase your EHP (effective hit points). Things such as '''racial resist''', '''max HP''', '''defense''', '''HP regen''' are some of the common examples. Due to how {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} works too, you can also consider getting '''max SP''' items on certain cases.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=5765 |slots=1 |item=Pitch B. Ribbon}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=19428 |item=Illusion Morpheus' Hood |slots=1}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=5363 |item=Abysmal Knight Helm |slots=1}}

[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Fallen Bio 5] is one of the most popular spot with 13 out of 14 mobs being boss there. Its downside is taking more damage from non-boss mobs, so only use it on specific places.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=5788 |item=3D Glasses}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15032 |slots=1 |item=Tidung}}

|Cheap '''5% all element''' resist. It is also slotted which makes this one a great deal for its price.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15128 |item=Excellion Suit}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|The good ol' Excellion. It gives '''max HP''' and is unbreakable during combat. The lack of slot is not a big deal either considering you can get {{Item List2 |id=4990 |item=Unfrozen}} and {{Item List2 |id=4988 |item=max HP}} enchants. It also has {{Item List2 |id=4981 |item=SP Regen Enchant}} if you decide to utilize {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} more.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15399 |slots=1 |item=Vit Soutane}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|Gives tons of HP thanks to {{Item List2 |id=41078 |item=Vit Blessing}} and '''max HP''' or '''VIT''' enchants. It also has in-built '''max HP''' and '''VIT''' on its own, which makes it a good option even at low refine.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15393 |slots=1 |item=Gold Dragon Plate}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|On top of tons of base '''max HP''' and '''VIT''', you can also get '''racial resist''' on this bad boy. More useful than {{Item List2 |id=15399 |slots=1 |item=Vit Soutane}} if you plan on stacking certain race resist.&lt;br>
It is recommended to use this armor if you are planning to use the '''Dragon Armor Set''' as it provides the most defensive bonus than other Dragon Plates.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15395 |slots=1 |item=Blue Dragon Plate}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|Similar to {{Item List2 |id=15393 |slots=1 |item=Gold Dragon Plate}} in '''resist''', this armor is more of a choice if you want to {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} tank due to the '''max SP''' it offers.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15348 |slots=1 |item=Illusion Goibne's Armor}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|Due to the sheer amount of '''DEF''' it provides, this armor is a worthy contender. Similar to {{Item List2 |id=19428 |item=Illusion Morpheus' Hood |slots=1}}, you can also get '''Stamina Nives''' on this armor for more '''HP'''.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15388 |slots=1 |item=King Schmidt's Suit}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|Can be enchanted with '''elemental property''' and '''VIT''', which makes it a good option for tanking certain content. It also offers '''10% resist vs. large and medium''' monsters at +11, the '''only''' armor so far to do that.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=1228 |item=Combat Knife}}
|&lt;center>Weapon&lt;/center>
|A good option vs. '''demi-human monsters''', though not really recommended in Bio5 because it also contain demon mobs. You can also get '''MDEF''' enchants or '''VIT''' via [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Malangdo_Enchant Malangdo Enchants].
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=1223 |item=Fortune Sword}}

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=2115 |slots=1 |item=Valkyrja's Shield}}
|&lt;center>Shield&lt;/center>
|The ol' classic. Can never go wrong with '''20% resist on Fire, Water, Undead and Shadow''' attacks. The little '''MDEF''' boost is also a nice addition.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=2168 |slots=1 |item=Immune Shield}}
|&lt;center>Shield&lt;/center>
|Due to the rise of '''Knight's Shield''', this shield has become almost irrelevant nowadays. Though in very specific content, it is still better. Custom content like [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Portal MH2] disables the Knight's Shield '''neutral resistance''' (refer [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Alterations here]), so this shield has its uses there.

|'''10% neutral resist''', very cheap
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=20773 |item=Excellion Wing}}

|&lt;center>Garment + Shoes&lt;/center>
|The combo provides '''15% max HP''' and '''5% max SP'''. This is not yet counting the amount of '''VIT''' enchants you can get on GSS itself and the Temporal Boots enchants (mainly {{Item List2 |item=Muscular Endurance | id=4878}} or {{Item List2 |item=Speed of Light | id=4877}}).

|&lt;center>Garment&lt;/center>
|The wing gives the same bonuses ('''1000 max HP''', more based on refine), but combos differently with other pieces of Illusion gear and different bonus at +7. You can put {{Item List2 |item=Above All Enchant | id=39542}} on this, which is one of the best defensive enchant you can get. If you want more resist you can also consider getting {{Item List2 |item=Defense Enchant | id=39527}} or {{Item List2 |item=Magic Defense Enchant | id=39528}}, though not mandatory.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Dragon Scale Hood |slots=1 |id=20946}}
|&lt;center>Garment&lt;/center>
|If you are planning to stack a '''racial resist''', this garment is just right for you. It also increases your '''healing received''' which can be helpful in certain scenarios, like '''MH2'''.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Angel Poring Boots | id=22101}}
|&lt;center>Shoes&lt;/center>
|Without enchant, this boots practically does nothing. {{Item List2 |item=Aquarius Stone | id=32210}} makes this shoes the only boots to give '''neutral resist''', which is useful for certain builds and content.

|When you don't have enough '''racial resist''', get this. It also completes your whole '''Dragon Armor Set''' (with {{Item List2 |id=15393 |slots=1 |item=Gold Dragon Plate}} is recommended) for strong defensive bonuses.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Black Rosary |slots=1 |id=2898}}
|&lt;center>Accessory&lt;/center>
|Running 100 MDEF build made easier because this accessory gives '''15 MDEF''', which is the biggest MDEF-granting accessory.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Glorious Ring |id=2772}}
|&lt;center>Accessory&lt;/center>
|This accessory gives '''10% resistance vs. basic elements attacks''' (Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth). Despite having no slot and covers only few elements, it is still pretty good.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Pendant of Harmony |id=2990}}
|&lt;center>Accessory&lt;/center>
|Aside from the '''HP and SP regen''', the other components of this accessory are what make it a strong defensive accessory. You can settle with lower level of {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} and utilize the regen this accessory provides.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Physical Enhancer Ring |slots=1 |id=2963}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Magic Intensifier Ring |slots=1 |id=2964}}
|&lt;center>Accessory&lt;/center>
|On a defensive build, you will want '''all element resist (except neutral)''' and or '''max HP''' enchants on this. Otherwise, it does so little for defensive builds.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Royal Guard Ring |slots=1 |id=28483}}
|&lt;center>Accessory (Right)&lt;/center>
|On top of the '''max HP''' and '''max SP''' it gives, you can also get a '''VIT''' enchant which is nice.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=King Schmidt's Rigid Insignia |slots=1 |id=52231}}
|&lt;center>Accessory (Left)&lt;/center>
|Flat out gives the most '''max HP''' bonus at base. It can also get '''VIT''' enchant to top it off.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4918 |item=Essence of Evil VIT 2}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=4919 |item=Essence of Evil VIT 3}}
|&lt;center>Card (Any)&lt;/center>
|Mostly recommended to be put on '''accessory''' and '''weapon''' as other slots have better alternatives. Gives '''VIT''', '''MDEF''', and '''DEF'''.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4582 |item=Bungisngis Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)
|Gives '''1% max HP''' per refine level. Recommended to be put on '''upper headgear''' as middle headgear cannot be refined.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27351 |item=Rigid Sky Deleter Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|'''5% max HP''' is never bad. Also combos with {{Item List2 |id=4582 |item=Bungisngis Card}}.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27115 |item=Ominous Permeter}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|Gives '''max SP''' for more {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} proc. Not half bad.
|-
|Headgear Elemental Resist Cards
|&lt;center>Headgear&lt;/center>
|Headgear cards also consist of elemental resist cards such as:
*{{Item List2 |id=4188 |item=Leib Olmai Card}} for '''10% Fire resist'''.
*{{Item List2 |id=4195 |item=Leaf Cat Card}} for '''10% Water resist'''.
and so on...
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27114 |item=Ominous Solider Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|Who needs {{Item List2 |id=4031 |item=Pecopeco Card}} when you got this? Gives overall more '''HP''' and '''DEF''' on top of it. Also combos with {{Item List2 |id=27115 |item=Ominous Permeter}} to boost each other bonuses.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=40002 |item=Toxious Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|Gives '''5% ranged resist''' on top of the '''10% max HP'''. An okay choice if you face a lot of ranged attacks.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27110 |item=Furious Gazeti Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|'''20% ranged''' resist is a big deal in certain scenarios, so this card is here as an option.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27112 |item=Furious Ice Titan Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|Though it gives so little '''DEF''', the combo it offers when combined with {{Item List2 |id=27111 |item=Furious Snowier Card}} is what makes this card a good option.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27354 |item=Contaminated Raydric Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|Only if you plan on using {{Item List2 |id=4133 |item=Raydric Card}} for '''10% more neutral resist'''. Otherwise, don't.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4608 |item=White Knight Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Weapon)&lt;/center>
|Use this if you plan on using {{Item List2 |id=4608 |item=Khalitzburg Knight Card}} for '''5% more medium and large size resist'''. Otherwise, stick to things.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4413 |item=Hodremlin Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shield)&lt;/center>
|'''15% all size resist''' can come in handy when fighting pesky small mobs, especially maggots in Bio5 or Old Glast Heim.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4608 |item=Khalitzburg Knight Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shield)&lt;/center>
|Covers most common mobs in end-game content, '''25% medium and large resist''' is a big deal, even as a DPS.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4253 |item=Alice Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shield)&lt;/center>
|When you are fighting a lot of boss-protocol mobs such in Bio5 or Gramps 175-200, this shield card is recommended as it gives '''40% boss resist'''.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4608 |item=Gaster Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shield)&lt;/center>
|No boss monsters? This one gives '''25% resist to non-boss mobs'''! Basically a bit similar to {{Item List2 |id=4413 |item=Hodremlin Card}} in a sense, just worse when fighting boss.
|-
|Shield Racial Resist Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Shield)&lt;/center>
|These type of cards are commonly used for tanking in '''MH2''' since stacking '''racial resist''' is one of the easier ways to make yourself tanky. Cards include:
*{{Item List2 |id=4120 |item=Sky Petite Card}} for '''30% Dragon resist'''.
*{{Item List2 |id=4083 |item=Rafflesia Card}} for '''30% Fish resist'''.
and so on...
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4334 |item=Noxious Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Garment)&lt;/center>
|'''10% neutral resist''' and '''10% ranged resist''' is pretty good. Combos with {{Item List2 |id=40002 |item=Toxious Card}} too.
|-
|Garment Elemental Resist Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Garment)&lt;/center>
|When doing content which does heavy damage of respective element, it is wise to get this type of card in your garment slot. Some includes:
* {{Item List2 |id=4109 |item=Jakk Card}} for '''30% Fire Element resist'''.
* {{Item List2 |id=4095 |item=Marse Card}} for '''30% Water Element resist'''.
* and even {{Item List2 |id=4133 |item=Raydric Card}} for the good ole '''20% neutral resist''' (monster auto attacks).
and so on...
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4381 |item=Green Ferus Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|Gives '''10% max HP''' and value +1 '''VIT''', great to stack up more HP.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4097 |item=Matyr Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|The only difference it has compared to {{Item List2 |id=4381 |item=Green Ferus Card}} is that it provides +1 AGI instead. Kinda a-ok if you aim to get tiny boost on ASPD or have this in your storage instead.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4107 |item=Verit Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|'''8% max HP and SP'''. Simple and boosts your survival a lot.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4160 |item=Firelock Soldier Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|Needs +9 to beat {{Item List2 |id=4107 |item=Verit Card}} ('''10% max HP and SP'''). Otherwise, stick with something else.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4100 |item=Sohee Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|'''15% max SP''' to prevent your SP from going down the drain with {{Skill List |id=463 |skill=Kaahi}} tanking.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=31022 |item=Abandoned Teddy Bear Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/centeR>
|Gives you a whooping '''20% max SP''', better than {{Item List2 |id=4100 |item=Sohee Card}}. Though its drawback can be a little restraining if you don't have Curse immunity yet.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4252 |item=Alligator Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|Simply provides you with '''5% ranged resist'''.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4349 |item=Errende Ebecee Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|Autocasts {{Skill List |id=25 |skill=Pneuma}} when getting hit, a good alternative for your ranged resist cards. Though backfires easily if your party has a lot of ranged DPS.
|}

=== DPS Equipment ===
'''How is SR DPS?'''&lt;br>
SR yields fairly high DPS, combined with their freedom to choose from 7 elements. Though their sub-par AoE kinda hinders them from handling group of mobs, so be mindful when trying to do certain content with large amount of mobs.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
'''What should I be looking in this section?'''&lt;br>
First, you need to know that {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}}, your main DPS skill, has 1 second fixed casting time, so you need '''fixed cast time reduction (FCTR)'''. Once you can eliminate it (via various ways listed down below), '''MATK''' will be the next important thing. '''ASPD''' is also important so can spam your skills faster, which essentially translates to more DPS. Other variables such as '''bonus elemental magic damage''' and '''MDEF pierce''' are also important to boost your DPS even further.

|&lt;center>Upper&lt;/center>
|One of the cheapest ways to remove '''fixed casting time''' as DPS SR. Aside from the FCTR it provides from proc, it also gives '''+30 MATK''' per refine level during the transformation duration. The '''10% damage vs. Undead''' is a nice icing on the cake, too.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=34286 |item=Antiquity Cap (GC) |slots=1}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=34279 |item=Antiquity Cap (EVT) |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Upper&lt;/center>
|Gives high raw '''MATK''' and also bonus '''all element magic damage boost''' +9. Furthermore, it gives the best value at +11 with its '''FCTR''' and '''magic damage vs. size''' mod.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=19249 |item=Spell Circuit (GC) |slots=1}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=32385 |item=Spell Circuit (EVT) |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Upper&lt;/center>
|Honestly only better than {{Item List2 |id=34286 |item=Antiquity Cap |slots=1}} if you manage to +13 it which is... super hard to get here. Not to mention that it is only better because of the FCTR it gives, and not damage-wise.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=19428 |item=Illusion Morpheus' Hood |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Upper&lt;/center>
|Lacks the firepower when compared to other upper headgears, mostly has its '''MATK''' boost from {{Item List2 |id=29100 |item=Spellbound Nive Lv 1}} and {{Item List2 |id=29101 |item=Spellbound Nive Lv 2}} enchant. Instead, it gives other values as listed on previous sections (VCTR, MDEF, and max SP).
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=5360 |item=Wickebine's Black Cat Ears}}
|&lt;center>Upper&lt;/center>
|Can be procced to get '''100% MDEF bypass''', which is huge on certain content in the game. Definitely a must get if you don't have access to high MDEF penetration.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=18528 |item=Drooping Neko Crew |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Upper&lt;/center>
|Another '''MDEF piercing''' gear which can be useful on certain scenarios. With the availability of MDEF piercing lately, this one can be a nice option to help you reach 100% MDEF pierce easier.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=32879 |item=Magical Booster | slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Middle&lt;/center>
|Can be enchanted with '''MATK''' and is also slotted. Easily the best in slot.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=32200 |item=Rosary In Mouth}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=32201 |item=Magical Rosary In Mouth}}
|&lt;center>Lower&lt;/center>
|The normal version provides more '''MATK''' than the magical one, but the bonus stats from the magical version can come in handy to boost your DPS too. The difference isn't that game changing, honestly.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=5463|item=Rainbow Scarf}}
|&lt;center>Lower&lt;/center>
|Gives '''1 INT''' and '''1% MATK''' which is good for DPS SR.
|-
|&lt;center>'''VMA + FWM Combo'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=19439 |item=Vicious Mind Aura}}&lt;br>&lt;center>+&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=20749 |item=Fallen Warrior Manteau |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Lower + Garment&lt;/center>
|Give tons of '''MATK''' and '''ASPD''' when paired. Pretty good choice if you have spare zeny to throw around (and is also usable on a couple other classes).
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15377 |slots=1 |item=Illusion Armor B-type}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|This armor gives the high raw '''MATK''' thanks to its {{Item List2 |id=39535 |item=Magic Enchant}}. It also pairs well with its other illusion counterpart which translates to more MATK.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15401 |slots=1 |item=Int Soutane}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|Gives tons of '''INT''' which easily translates to more MATK, not to mention the '''MATK%''' it gives. Solid option considering INT also translates to cast time and more SP for spamming. Aside from that, it also gives VCTR (as mentioned in VCTR Equipment section).
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15400 |slots=1 |item=Dex Soutane}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|Another option to handle your '''FCTR''', this soutane gives 0.3s FCTR with {{Item List2 |id=41079 |item=Dex Blessing}}. It definitely lost in terms of damage when compared to the other armors, but what makes this armor favorable is its '''ASPD'''. I personally use this armor to solo and get 193 ASPD from the '''ASPD%''' and massive DEX it provides. In party setup, other armor simply outshines this one since you can get ASPD easier.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=15395 |slots=1 |item=Blue Dragon Plate}}
|&lt;center>Armor&lt;/center>
|At +11 t gives you okay-ish MATK and most importantly, '''0.2s FCTR'''. The catch is, it provides more MATK than a {{Item List2 |id=15400 |slots=1 |item=Dex Soutane}}, but less ASPD and cast time reduction.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=26154 |item=Spirit Pendulum |slots=2}}
|&lt;center>Weapon&lt;/center>
|One of sources of {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}} damage mod at the moment, this weapon is definitely a very good contender in the list of DPS SR weapons.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=26151 |item=Rutilus Stick-OS |slots=2}}
|&lt;center>Weapon&lt;/center>
|Combos with {{Item List2 |id=34286 |item=Antiquity Cap (GC) |slots=1}} (or {{Item List2 |id=34279 |item=Antiquity Cap (EVT) |slots=1}}), it provides yet another {{Skill List |id=2602 |skill=Espa}} damage mod which makes it a great contender too as DPS SR weapon.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=1600 |item=Vicious Mind Rod |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Weapon&lt;/center>
|Honestly not a bad weapon if you can get it highly refined since it provides high '''MATK'''. It is also possible to get '''MDEF pierce''' on this weapon which is very good for magic DPS.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=26162 |item=Welding Wand |slots=2}}
|&lt;center>Weapon&lt;/center>
|Arguably the best weapon for Soul Reaper right now because of several reasons. Firstly, its high '''MATK''' and possibly good damage enchants. Second, it combos with '''Einbech Accessories''' ({{Item List2 |item=Safety Pendant B |slots=1 |id=42249}} and {{Item List2 |item=Safety Epaulete B |slots=1 |id=42251}}) to give you 0.3s FCTR, which helps you to reach to instant cast. It also gives you bonus '''elemental magic damage boost''', as well as '''damage bonus vs. size''' proc.
|-
|&lt;center>'''Knight's Shields'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Cursed Knight's Shield |slots=1 |id=32368}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Bloody Knight's Shield |slots=1 |id=28945}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |id=28946}}
|&lt;center>Shield&lt;/center>
|Gives you everything you want in one. '''ASPD'''? Check. '''MATK'''? Check. With {{Item List2 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |id=28946}} too you can get '''MDEF pierce''' enchant which is very sought for since it can make your damage skyrocket.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=20934 |item=Illusion Engine Wing B-type |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Garment&lt;/center>
|Combos with {{Item List2 |id=15377 |slots=1 |item=Illusion Armor B-type}} to give '''50 MATK'''. On top of that, you can get {{Item List2 |id=39537 |item=Fast Enchant}} to further boost your ASPD.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=20940 |slots=1 |item=Violet Halo}}
|&lt;center>Garment&lt;/center>
|At high refine, this garment provides the most raw '''MATK'''. A pretty solid option. Also combo with {{Item List2 |id=32879 |item=Magical Booster | slots=1}} for more VCTR.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=20966 |item=Temporal Int Manteau |slots=1}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=65405 |item=Temporal Int Manteau (Bound) |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Garment&lt;/center>
|Damage-wise, this garment is the best that we have right now. Not to mention you can further enchant it with MATK (considering Soul Reapers don't need ACDR) for even more damage. The MDEF pierce it provides is also nice, though too specific against certain mobs.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=22197 |item=Illusion Leg B-type |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Shoes&lt;/center>
|Aside the fact it combos with other B-type counterparts, this shoes provides the most '''FCTR''' right now, with a whooping 0.7s FCTR at +9 with {{Item List2 |id=39541 |item=Fixed Casting Enchant}}. This way, you will only need either {{Item List2 |id=15400 |slots=1 |item=Dex Soutane}} or '''Einbech Combo''' to get the remaining 0.3s FCTR. It also has {{Item List2 |id=39548 |item=Spell Buster Enchant}} that drastically improves your DPS upon proc.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=22010 |item=Temporal DEX Boots |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Shoes&lt;/center>
|An option if you can reduce 0.5s FCTR through other means. Getting {{Item List2 |id=4876 |item=Runaway Magic}} is important because it pairs with '''King Schmidt's Insignia''' to further boost your DPS
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=52229 |item=King Schmidt's Divine Power Insignia |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Accessory (Left)&lt;/center>
|With {{Item List2 |id=39590 |item=Divine Power}} enchant, this accessory is the best at boosting your damage per Espa.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=2964 |item=Magic Intensifier Ring |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Accessory&lt;/center>
|With '''MATK''' enchants, this accessory is the best contender damage-wise if you are already using {{Item List2 |id=52229 |item=King Schmidt's Divine Power Insignia |slots=1}} in your left accessory.
|-
|&lt;center>'''Illusion Battle Chips'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=42209 |item=Illusion Battle Chip R |slots=1}}&lt;br>&lt;center>+&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=42210 |item=Illusion Battle Chip L |slots=1}}
|&lt;center>Accessories&lt;/center>
|Gives you '''5% MATK''' at base. The enchants you can get on these further enhance your DPS, such as {{Item List2 |id=4881 |item=ASPD Lv. 4}} for '''ASPD''' and {{Item List2 |id=4812 |item=Spell 4}} for more '''MATK''' and VCTR.
|-
|&lt;center>'''Einbech Accessories Combo'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Safety Pendant B |slots=1 |id=42249}}&lt;br>&lt;center>+&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Safety Epaulete B |slots=1 |id=42251}}
|&lt;center>Accessories&lt;/center>
|Gives '''5 all stats''' and '''5% MATK''' for the important ones, as well as '''0.3s FCTR''' if you decide to use {{Item List2 |id=26162 |item=Welding Wand |slots=2}}. Really good combo if you decide to run DPS SR in party setup considering this set lacks ASPD.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4912 |item=Essence of Evil INT 2}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=4913 |item=Essence of Evil INT 3}}
|&lt;center>Card (Any)&lt;/center>
|Super cheap option for little '''MATK''' boost. Also '''INT''' to help you reach instant cast easier, as well as more SP.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4557 |item=Weakened Fenrir Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|Normal headgear card that provides the most raw '''MATK'''. Considering how varied SR elements can be, this one is an option if you are on a budget.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4583 |item=Engkanto Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|Gives you '''30% more damage vs. Poison''' enemies. Considering Poison mobs don't have a significant weakness vs. any element, this card is a must have for them.
|-
|Headgear Elemental Damage Boost Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Headgear)&lt;/center>
|These cards give 5% of '''elemental damage boost''', and gives another 5% at +9. Some of those includes:
* {{Item List2 |id=4599 |item=Lichtern Red Card}} for Fire damage boost.
* {{Item List2 |id=4597 |item=Lichtern Blue Card}} for Water damage boost.
and so on...
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4409 |item=Agav Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|'''5% MATK''' boost is pretty good, and there aren't many cards to compete that amount of damage in this slot. The downside can be ignored most of the time since DEF works differently in renewal.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27101 |item=Sweet Nightmare Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Armor)&lt;/center>
|Gives '''20 MATK''' which isn't bad per se. It also offers uninterruptable casting time which can be useful in one way or another.
|-
|Weapon Racial Mod Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Weapon)&lt;/center>
|These cards give '''10% more magic damage''' to specific mob race. Some of them include:
* {{Item List2 |id=4474 |item=Zakudam Card}} for Demi-Human mobs
* {{Item List2 |id=4475 |item=Cobalt Mineral Card}} for Formless mobs
and so on...
|-
|Weapon Size Mod Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Weapon)&lt;/center>
|These cards give '''bonus damage to specific size'''. They are:
* {{Item List2 |id=27286 |item=Colorful Teddy Bear Card}} for Large mobs.
* {{Item List2 |id=27289 |item=Soul Fragment Card}} for Medium mobs.
* {{Item List2 |id=27172 |item=Elite Scimitar Buffalo Bandit Card}} for Small mobs (also combos with other cards for further boost).
|-
|Weapon Element Mod Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Weapon)&lt;/center>
|Gives you '''bonus damage to specific element'''. These cards include:
* {{Item List2 |id=27359 |item=Ice Ghost Card}} for Water mobs.
* {{Item List2 |id=27360 |item=Flame Ghost Card}} for Fire mobs.
|-
|Weapon Element Damage Boost Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Weapon)&lt;/center>
|Pretty fresh addition so there isn't a lot of them. Right now there is:
* {{Item List2 |id=40009 |item=Spectral Plasma Card}} for Ghost damage boost.
* {{Item List2 |id=40010 |item=Arch Plasma Card}} for Wind damage boost.
* {{Item List2 |id=40011 |item=Holy Frus Card}} for Holy damage boost.
|-
|MDEF Bypass Combo Cards
|&lt;center>Card  (Weapon &amp; Shield)&lt;/center>
|As of now, kRO has only released two sets of MDEF bypass cards. They give minor damage boost to those specific races (weapon), as well as damage reduction from those races (shield). Wearing the combo is more recommended however, which gives you 50% MDEF pierce against them. Those sets are:
* {{Item List2 |id=4626 |item=Big Ben Card}} + {{Item List2 |id=4628 |item=Neo Punk Card}} for Formless and Demon MDEF pierce.
* {{Item List2 |id=4654 |item=Nightmare Mimic Card}} + {{Item List2 |id=4653 |item=Nightmare Arclouse Card}} for Brute and Undead MDEF pierce.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27177 |item=Marsh Arclouse Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Garment)&lt;/center>
|One of the best garment cards as it gives tons of '''MATK''' and '''ASPD'''. Definitely a must get since it's not locked to specific element too.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27315 |item=Mutant Venenum Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Garment)&lt;/center>
|If you have some Brute mobs you want to kill, this one is the right card for this slot. Gives you '''15% more magic damage vs. Brute''' mobs.
|-
|Garment Elemental Damage Boost Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Garment)&lt;/center>
|Specific '''element damage boost''' can be useful on certain content, so it's worth considering since they give the best output damage-wise. These cards include:
* {{Item List2 |id=4657 |item=Nightmare Ancient Mummy Card}} for Fire damage.
* {{Item List2 |id=27167 |item=Faceworm Larvae Card}} for Water damage.
and so on...
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4658 |item=Nightmare Verit Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|General '''MATK''' boosting card in shoes, perfect for people who are lazy to swap &lt;s>like me&lt;/s>.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27121 |item=Piranha Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|Similar to {{Item List2 |id=27315 |item=Mutant Venenum Card}}, this one is generally used when you are fighting specific mob type, in this case it gives '''bonus damage vs. fish'''.
|-
|Shoes Element Damage Boost Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Shoes)&lt;/center>
|If you need more boost on your '''element magic damage''', try these ones for size. These category includes:
* {{Item List2 |id=27255 |item=Ordre Card}} for Wind and Water damage boost.
* {{Item List2 |id=27259 |item=Licheni Card}} for Holy damage boost &lt;s>and value 5% heal lesgoooo&lt;/s>
and so on...
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=4505 |item=Scaraba Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|I mean... it's a very cheap option. '''+20 MATK''' is kinda a-ok if you're just starting out but there are definitely better, albeit expensive, alternatives.
|-
|{{Item List2 |id=27108 |item=Singing Ferre Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|'''20% more magic damage to neutral''' mobs is a pretty good deal considering they don't have certain element as their weakness.
|-
|&lt;center>'''Jewelry Ant + Ungoliant Combo'''&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=40000 |item=Jewelry Ant Card}}&lt;br>&lt;center>+&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |id=4336 |item=Ungoliant Card}}
|&lt;center>Cards (Accessory &amp; Headgear)&lt;/center>
|Although '''neutral magic damage boost''' is unlikely to be used by Soul Reapers due to {{Skill List |id=425 |skill= Warm Wind}}, it is still a decent option since your next best alternative for neutral damage boost is {{Item List2 |id=27262 |item=Dwigh Card}}.
|-
|Accessory Element Damage Boost Cards
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|Gives you '''20% element damage boost''' on 2 specific elements. These cards are the go-to choice for this slot as magic DPS class. They include:
* {{Item List2 |id=27161 |item=Mavka Card}} for Fire and Earth damage boost.
* {{Item List2 |id=27125 |item=Headless Mule Card}} for Water and Holy damage boost.
and so on...

=== Misc Equipment ===
'''What does this equipment do?'''&lt;br>
It basically covers everything that does not really belong on previous sections. Things such as '''uninterruptable cast''', '''status immunity / resist''' and other miscellaneous things belong here.

|-
|{{Item List2 |id=18874 |slots=1 |item=Monocle}}
|&lt;center>Middle&lt;/center>
|Slotted middle headgear that gives no stats. Good budget option if you are just looking for something with slot.
|-
|{{Item List2 |item=Mad Bunny |slots=1|id=2189}}&lt;br>&lt;center>- or -&lt;/center>{{Item List2 |item=Mad Bunny (EVT) |slots=1|id=32369}}
|&lt;center>Shield&lt;/center>
|As has been explained, reflect gears work to proc your {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}}. This also opens up meme build for '''autocast reflect Soul Reaper''' since reflect counts as normal attacks.
|-
|{{Item List |id=4569 |item=(Bio 4) Chen Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Garment)&lt;/center>
|Can help you in dire needs. As have been mentioned and explained previously, get this card since it can help you in many ways possible as a Soul Reaper.
|-
|{{Item List |id=4283 |item=Greatest General Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|With the help of reflect gears, this card can be a nice addition to help you gain soul even faster. Not a bad choice if you don't know what else to slap on your accessory.
|-
|{{Item List |id=27120 |item=Iara Card}}
|&lt;center>Card (Accessory)&lt;/center>
|{{Skill List |id=72 |skill=Status Recovery}} is a decent skill to recover statuses from your party members, '''Frozen''' being the most common. Definitely a decent contender for your accessory slot.
|-
|Status Immunity Gears
|&lt;center>Varies&lt;/center>
|Achieving status immunity is very important as any SR role you play. As support, it allows you to keep buffing your teammates or dispelling their debuffs via other means. As DPS, you can keep spamming without being interrupted, resulting in consistent damage. Some examples for "common" status debuff you want to resist are '''Frozen''' and '''Stone Curse'''.
* {{Item List2 |id=4990 |item=Unfrozen}} enchant on {{Item List2 |id=15128 |item=Excellion Suit}} or even {{Item List2 |id=4105 |item=Marc Card}} gives you immunity to Frozen.
* Double {{Item List2 |id=4358 |item=Gemini-S58 Card}} gives you immunity to Stone Curse with 80 VIT or higher. There is also {{Item List2 |id=4124 |item=Medusa Card}} on shield slot.
Additionally, you can also achieve '''100 MDEF''' via various methods to get immunity from these two statuses. It depends on your budget and how you want to achieve them personally.
|-
|Autocast Gears
|&lt;center>Varies&lt;/center>
|Autocasting can be useful depending on the content. Some autocast gears also do damage to proc off {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}} and thus, helps you to gain souls much faster. Some autocast gears also debuff enemies which can greatly increase your survivability. With '''reflect gears''' too you can make gears that proc off skills on attacks work since reflect counts as normal attacks. Some examples of autocast gears I personally use on my Soul Reaper are:
* {{Item List2 |item=Elephant Model Hat | slots=1| id=18929}} for {{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust}} autocast when hit. The frozen and knockback aspects of the skill can help you to get some breathing room. It also hits enemies multiple times, giving you higher probability to get more souls off {{Skill List |id=2607 |skill=Soul Reaper}}.
* {{Item List2 |id=31020 |item=Malicious Cold Ghost Card}} autocasts [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Curse Curse] on attacking enemies. Curse reduces the movement speed drastically and also lowers their damage, which makes it ideal when you are trying to lure big amount of mobs without taking too much damage.
There are also many more autocasting gears that can be useful, and I will leave it at you guys to experiment on it.
