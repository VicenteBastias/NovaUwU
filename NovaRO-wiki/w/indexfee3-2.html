= Overview =
Hello everyone, this is Mayo and welcome to my Warlock guide. In this guide, I would like to walk you through the basic mechanics of the class, share some builds, gameplay tips and suggestions on equipments.&lt;br />
About me, I haven‚Äôt really been a wizard player before renewal. With the introduction of 3rd classes, the role and play style of Wizards have shifted, and my love for the class have begun. I would like to say that I do not think that I‚Äôm the most expert Warlock around, but I can enlighten new, inexperienced players about the class. &lt;br />
Warlocks are a very versatile class, used for many roles in parties such as tanks, damage dealers, or crowd control supports. With almost screen wide AoEs, excellent utility skills they are a great addition to any party. But with great strength comes many drawbacks. Warlocks have the lowest HP modifier among 3rd classes (not counting expanded classes), have extremely low weight capacity, and probably one of the most tedious classes to gear.&lt;br />
This guide is tailored specifically for '''NovaRO''', I can‚Äôt guarantee this will be of any use for players from other servers. 
&lt;br /> Most of the data is based on personal experience and research, therefore it can be incorrect or others might disagree with them. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to find me on NovaRO Discord or the forums under the name Mayo, you can either send me a private messages or just @ at me, I'll come running.

= Cast time reduction =

Cast time, delays and cooldowns are extremely important when you‚Äôre playing a Warlock. Renewal has changed the cast time formula completely, and introduced cooldowns on top of after-cast delays.&lt;br />
Cast time consist of a fixed, and a variable part. As a rule of thumb, fixed cast time is the 20% of the total cast time, although there are skills with completely fixed cast time (such as [[File:Mg energycoat.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Energy_Coat '''Energy Coat''']), and skills with no fixed cast time (such as [[File:Wl soulexpansion.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Soul_Expansion '''Soul Expansion''']).
Variable cast time is reduced by two things: your stats and your equipment. Both have different mechanics and effect on your total cast time.
=== Decreasing variable cast time with stat points ===

To reach zero Variable Cast Time with stats only, the following formula has to be used:&lt;br />
&lt;pre> DEX √ó 2 + INT = 530 &lt;/pre>
Yes, at first glance, it does sound like an insane number. But let‚Äôs take a look at the math here first. Some examples of reaching 530 points:&lt;br />
*'''INT''' 170 and '''DEX''' 180
*'''INT''' 190 and '''DEX''' 170
*'''INT''' 530
*'''DEX''' 265
With 130 being the max stat in Renewal, that doesn‚Äôt sound so bad does it? Especially after you think about how easy it is to raise your stat points temporarily. The Archbishop skill Clementia adds +16 '''DEX''' and '''INT''', foods are capable of adding +30 '''DEX''' and '''INT'''.&lt;br />
*+10 '''INT'''{{Item List |id=12204 |item='''Dragon Breath Cocktail''' |simple=yes}}
*+10 '''DEX'''{{Item List |id=12205 |item='''Hwergelmir‚Äôs Tonic''' |simple=yes}}&lt;br />
''Obtainable by cooking, [[Cash Shop]], [[Automated_Events#Mysterious_Slot_Machine|Slot machine]], various boxes, 30 minute duration''
*+20 '''INT'''[[File:Cocktail.png]][http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12430/warg-blood-cocktail '''Warg Blood Cocktail''']
*+20 '''DEX'''[[File:Icetea.png]][http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12432/siroma-icetea '''Siroma Icetea''']&lt;br />
''Obtainable by the Genetic skill [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/index.php?title=AloeLeaflet%27s_Alchemist_Class_Guide#Item_Creation '''Mixed Cooking'''], 5 minute duration'' &lt;br />
At 60 job, Warlocks get 13 '''INT''', and 8 '''DEX''' from job bonuses. If we do the math here, that would total a massive 167 points towards your cast time. With 120 '''DEX''' and 120 '''INT''', you would total 527 points. And we haven‚Äôt taken stat points gained from gears into calculation just yet.

=== Decreasing variable cast time with equipment ===

Some equipment, mostly cards and enchants are capable of reducing your variable cast time by a percentage. This is an extremely expensive build, sacrificing all the damage you can to reduce cast time. Reaching 100% reduction would leave you with 0 variable cast time, even with 1 '''DEX''' and 1 '''INT''' points.&lt;br />
IMPORTANT: Percentage cast time reduction and reduction from stat points do not additively stack together. 
Example: you are casting a spell with 10 seconds of variable cast time, and no fixed cast time.
Let‚Äôs say so you managed to reach 400 points, which means you have reduced 75% of your cast time from stats only. You are left with 2.5 seconds cast time.&lt;br />
You put on some gear, that lets say reduces 25% of your cast time. 75 + 25 = 100, right? Well, unfortunately, not in this case. The 25% only applies after the reduction by stats NOT the original cast time, which would mean, 25% of the 2.5 seconds. This would leave you with roughly 1.8 seconds of cast time.&lt;br />
For this reason, I would heavily advise against using cast time reduction gear altogether, unless you are planning on reaching 90-100% reduction by equipment only.&lt;br />

'''Note:''' Poem Of Bragi's cast time reduction '''stacks''' with this kind of reduction, while '''Suffragium''', '''Isilla Card''' and '''Intense Telekinesis''' '''does not'''.

Notable equipment to reduce cast time:&lt;br />
*{{Item List |id=5564 |item=Crown Of Deceit |slots= 1 |num= +9 |simple=yes}} (from [[Cash Shop]]) with {{Card |id=4366 Kathryne Keyron Card}}: 29% reduction&lt;br />
*Spell enchants (from [[Enchantment#Malangdo_Enchant|Malangdo Enchants]], [[Old Glast Heim]] instances): 10% reduction each&lt;br />
*{{Item List |id=2016 |item=Vellum Arc Wand |num= +9 |simple=yes}}: 50% reduction (in WoE/PvP)&lt;br />
*{{Item List |id=20744 |item=Ferlock's Cloack |num= +9 |slots= 1 |simple=yes}} (from [[Airship Assault]]): 30% reduction&lt;br />

=== Fixed cast time ===

Fixed cast time can only be reduced by buffs and equipment.&lt;br />
Percentage based reductions do not stack here, only the strongest one is applied. 
For example: Having Radius at level 3 reduces your fixed cast time by 20%, but your Archbishop friend casts Sacrament on you, which reduces your fixed cast time by 50%. Since only the strongest one applies, your fixed cast time will be reduced only by 50%&lt;br />
However, fixed (flat) reduction does stack with percentage reduction, and also with itself. This makes it possible to reduce fixed cast time to zero.

Equipment that reduces your fixed cast time by an amount:&lt;br />
*{{Item List |nid=22010 |id=22008 |item=Temporal Dex Boots|slots= 1 |simple=yes}} (Obtainable from [[Old Glast Heim]] instance): 0.5s reduction&lt;br />
*{{Item List |id=2016 |item=Vellum Arc Wand|num= +9 |simple=yes}}: 0.2s reduction (in WoE/PvP)&lt;br />
*{{Item List |id=5464 |item=Zaha Doll Hat |slots= 1|simple=yes}}: 0.08s reduction per refine level while transformed

= Reading Spell Book =

Reading Spell Book skill now allows Warlocks to instant cast previously stored spells. To store a spell, you have to have the specific spell book in your inventory, cast the skill, and choose which one you‚Äôd like to store. Each spell book have their own ‚Äúmind slot‚Äù cost ‚Äì the more powerful the spell the more slots it‚Äôll take. Mind slots can be increased by base level (1 for every 10 base level), '''INT''' (1 for every 10 '''INT''') and by the skill [[File:Wl freeze sp.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Freezing_Spell '''Freezing Spell''']. The amount of spells stored can be calculated by the following formula:&lt;pre>
Slots = (4*Freezing Spell Lv) + floor(BLv/10) + floor(INT/10)&lt;/pre>
Once you have your spells stored, cast [[File:Wl release.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Release '''Release'''], and a random spell from your stored ones will be released. Even if the spell is ground target (such as [[File:Wl earthstrain.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Earth_Strain '''Earth Strain'''] or [[File:Wl comet.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Comet '''Comet''']), you will need a target to use Release, but the spell will still act as ground target, and will be blocked by skills such as Maelstorm and Land Protector.&lt;br />
Releasing a spell will activate the cooldown and global skill delay of the spell, leaving you unable to manually cast the spell again until the cooldown is done, but allowing you to release it again. Because of this, it is recommended to cast skills with lower cast time and longer cooldown (such as [[File:Wl crimsonrock.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Crimson_Rock '''Crimson Rock''']) first, and then Release the stored spells. This allows you to cast these spells up to 4 times ‚Äì once casted, and released 3 times ‚Äì without having to worry about cooldown. This also makes it possible to ‚ÄúComet spam‚Äù ‚Äì storing up 2 Comets, and releasing them without cooldown then storing them up again.&lt;br />

You can purchase spell books at the Geffen Mage guild ('''/navi geffen_in 174/112''') from Lea after talking to Magic Book Master Velof.

|[[File:Mg firewall.gif]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Fire_Wall '''Fire Wall''']
|It's hard to stress how important and powerful this skill is while fighting monsters. The technique, called "vertical fire walling (vfw)" exists since the beginning of time, and one of the hardest mechanic a beginner Magician has to learn. At early Magician levels, its damage ''alone'' will destroy undead monsters, making you fly through the early Magician stage in no time. At later levels, it is mainly used for protection, and helping to proc such effects as Reckless Magic, Isilla card.&lt;br />
''(Tip: Some help to understand vertical fire walling can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X7AVG2JO68 '''here'''], and to master it click [http://vfw.gn0.me/ '''here'''].)''&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 10
|-
|[[File:Mg fireball.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Fire_Ball '''Fire Ball''']
| Another great spell for early leveling, although it will become quite useless at later levels. Amazing for mobbing at Orc Dungeon. I would recommend getting this as a Magician, then dropping it at later levels.&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 10 (only as a Magician)
|-
|[[File:Mg safetywall.gif]] [Http://irowiki.org/wiki/Safety_Wall '''Safety Wall''']
| A Magician needs all the protection they can get. Blocks 12 hits, very fast casting time. You should be using this at all times on yourself/allies, it will help so your cast doesn't get interrupted. At later levels, it is possible to tank MvPs with spamming Safety Wall constantly on one cell. Consumes 1 [[File: Bgem.gif]] [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/717/blue-gemstone Blue Gemstone].&lt;br />

'''Recommended level:''' 1
|-
|[[File:Mg energycoat.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Energy_Coat '''Energy Coat''']
|A massive damage reduction in the cost of your SP. I wouldn't recommend using it while leveling, because it will eat your SP up really fast, but a must in PvP.&lt;br />

|[[File:Wz stormgust.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Storm_Gust '''Storm Gust''']
|This skill has been one of the most important spells as a Wizard for years. Offers great damage and crowd control, leaves enemies frozen by a chance. It is recommended to use lv10 for damage, lv1 for crowd control.&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 10
|-
|[[File:Wz_frostnova.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Frost_Nova '''Frost Nova''']
|You might think I've gone insane listing this spell if you're unfamiliar with the renewal changes. Frost Nova now offers great utility and crowd control for solo plays with insanely fast cast times and high success chances. Use it while mobbing in Juperos and other mobby maps, then hit enemies with Crimson Rock (Fire element deals 90% to Water1 element).&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 7-10
|-
|[[File:Wz heavendrive.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Heaven's_Drive '''Heaven's Drive''']
|Great spell for unhiding Thief classes in PvP/GvG. Fast cast time, low cost. &lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 1
|-
|[[File:Wz quagmire.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Quagmire '''Quagmire''']
|Amazing for mobbing, and PvP. Reduces the movement speed, AGI and DEX of the targets and also Movement speed buffs such as Increase AGI, Cart Boost. Only 3 Quagmires can be active at a time. Lower skill levels have lower durations, allowing you to place your Quagmires at different locations more frequently. Affects allies in PvP/GvG.&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 3-5
|-
|[[File:Hw souldrain.gif]] [HTTP://irowiki.org/wiki/Soul_Drain '''Soul Drain''']

|[[File:Wl soulexpansion.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Soul_Expansion '''Soul Expansion''']
|Your main damage spell for single-targets (or very little, 5x5 AoE), and an amazing spell for farming. This skill has fast cast, no cooldown, just a 0.5 second delay which can easily be reduced by Bard's skill Poem of Bragi - makes it very much spammable with only ASPD delay. Damage is easily amplified by equipment.&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 5
|-
|[[File:Wl whiteimprison.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/White_Imprison '''White Imprison''']
|Locks a target in a transparent box by chance that prevents damage except from Ghost property. Imprisoned targets can't use potions, skills and cannot move, and most importantly, they take amplified damage from Soul Expansion. &lt;br />
This skill can be used on the caster itself, which provides amazing utility for tanking MvPs, or burst skills in PvP. When casted on yourself, it lasts 5 seconds and has a 4 second cooldown, making it possible to tank MvPs (that do not have ghost attack) indefinitely.&lt;br />
''(Tip: Use lv1 of this skill when casting on yourself to take less damage)''&lt;br />

'''Recommended level:''' 2 or 5

|[[File:Wl earthstrain.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Earth_Strain '''Earth Strain''']
|Deals Earth property damage, but most importantly, strips the equipment of the enemy by high chance.

This skill has amplified damage and lower SP cost, also removes the Red Gemstone cost if used while having other Warlocks in your party.&lt;br />
Comet "spam" is a usual tactic for WoE and PvM, which has been further explained [[#Reading Spell Book|here]]&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 5 (optional)
|-
|[[File:Wl_tetravortex.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Tetra_Vortex '''Tetra Vortex''']
|Your ultimate single-target burst spell. Requires elemental balls summoned. The property of the damage depends on the summoned balls. Excellent for low level MvPs, and nuking single targets in PvP/WoE. It is recommended to use Earth/Wind property against players.&lt;br />
'''Recommended level:''' 5 (optional)

=Stats=
*'''Strength (STR)'''
For Warlocks, mainly used for increasing Weight Limit, which helps with Masquerade resistance as well. If you can spare some points, it's nice to have 20-30 STR.
*'''Agility (AGI)'''
Both an offensive and a defensive stat. Raises [http://novaragnarok.com/wiki/Attack_Speed Attack speed], and flee rate. Attack speed reduces ASPD delay, which makes a huge difference in your skill spam, flee gives you a little more protection against monsters. For most builds, 100 AGI is recommended. &lt;br /> 100 AGI gives immunity against Bleeding and Sleep statuses, also reduces the duration of Masquerades.  It is advised to have ''at least'' 175 ASPD. &lt;br />
(''Little note to the video - Genetic's [[File:CartCannon.png]][http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cart_Cannon '''Cart Cannon'''] and Warlock's [[File:Wl soulexpansion.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Soul_Expansion '''Soul Expansion'''] share the same mechanics in terms of cast time and delay.'')&lt;br />
*'''Vitality (VIT)'''
Every point of VIT raises your Max HP by +1% and the effectiveness of potions. Since we have the lowest HP modifier among 3rd classes, and tend to die ''pretty easily'' in both party and PvP situations, it is advised to run at least 100 total VIT.&lt;br />
100 VIT gives immunity to Stun and Curse, and protects against Crystallization, Freezing and Mandragora Howling.  
*'''Intelligence (INT)'''
A Mage's bread and butter, directly raises your mATK by +1.5 per point, decreases your [[#Decreasing variable cast time with stat points| cast time]], raises your SP pool and regeneration. Also gives immunity to Silence, helps with Sleep, Deep Sleep and Oblivion Curse duration.&lt;br />
Since it is one of our main stats to get damage out of, it is recommended to get 120 base INT, however I would not recommend getting more than 120 base INT -  it becomes very expensive in terms of status points to raise it - you can get more mATK and utility out of some LUK and DEX.
*'''Dexterity (DEX)'''
Primary stat to reduce [[#Decreasing variable cast time with stat points| cast time]], but it also raises your ASPD, and your mATK by 1/5 therefore it is ideal to have your DEX at multiples of 5. I would recommend getting around 105-120 base DEX, depending whether you want instant cast (or can get it elsewhere) or not. &lt;br /> The difference between you and your target's DEX affects the chance of divest from [[File:Wl earthstrain.gif]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Earth_Strain '''Earth Strain'''], and it also helps with Freezing duration.
*'''Luck (LUK)'''
This stat has gotten a major update with the introduction of renewal. Now every 3 points of LUK gives an additional +1 ATK/mATK, which makes it a very viable option to gain some mATK at later levels. Raising your INT from 120 to 130 would require you to use 340 stat points and would net you +15 mATK, while raising LUK from 1 to 30 would cost you only 86 stat points, and raise your mATK by +10. Glass Cannon and damage oriented builds usually have 30 or 60 LUK, depending on the player's taste.

= Example builds =
In this section I will suggest some skill/gear/stat builds, their uses and some general game-play pointers for them.&lt;br /> They are '''examples''', tweak them to your own budget and playstyle. These are all my own builds, so take them with a grain of salt. To understand the full reasoning behind them, please refer to the corresponding sections above. &lt;br />
Before going into detail, lets start with a general Mage and Wizard skill build, which I use for most of my builds.

[[File:MayoWizard.png]][[File:MayoMage.png]]

'''Most frequently used skills''':
*'''Safety Wall''' - survivability
*'''Fire Wall''' - crowd control
*'''Energy Coat''' - damage reduction
*'''Frost Nova''' - crowd control
*'''Storm Gust''' level 1 or 10 - level 1 for crowd control, 10 for damage 
*'''Quagmire''' - crowd control
*'''Mystical Amplification''' - damage boost
==== The Elementalist ====
----

'''Gameplay:'''
*Mainly for '''PvM''', shines in party scenarios
*Can be used as MvP tank thanks to '''White Imprison'''. Further explained at the [[Mayo's_Warlock_Guide#Psychokinetic_branch|Skills section]]
*'''Jack Frost''' and '''Frosty Misty''' provides great ''crowd control'' and act as secondary damage source
*'''Crimson Rock''' and '''Earth Strain''' as your main source of damage
*'''Drain Life''' gives more survivability in solo play and farming
*'''Chain Lightning''' and '''Soul Expansion''' provides amazing DPS at single targets with '''Poem Of Bragi''' (situational, heavily gear reliant)

'''Skill build:'''

[[File:MayoEle.png]]

'''Stat build:'''
*'''STR''' 1
*'''AGI''' 96 - for great spammability, some extra flee
*'''VIT''' 94 - rounds up to 100 with job bonuses, extra HP and Stun resistance
*'''INT''' 120 - for MATK and INT Temporal Boots bonus
*'''DEX''' 120 - for Cast time reduction and DEX Temporal Boots bonus
*'''LUK''' 1

'''Key pieces of equipment:'''
*An overupgraded {{Item List |id=1680 |item=Crimson Rod |slots= 2 |simple=yes}} with the respecitve MDEF Pierce card sets (mentioned in the Equipment section)
*Any of the elemental sets (see [[#Elemental_sets |respecitve section]] for more explaination). Ideally, swapping between Fire and Ghost/Wind would cover most enemies you'd face in an instance setting.
*{{Item List |id=2027 |item=Sunflower Boy |slots= 2 |simple=yes}} + {{Item List |id=5360 |item=Wickebine's Black Cat Ears  |slots= 0|simple=yes}} for more all-round usage
*{{Item List |nid=22010 |id=22008 |item=Temporal Dex Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} for fixed cast time reduction
*{{Item List |nid=22007 |id=22009 |item=Temporal Int Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, situational, for Soul Expansion spam

====The Support / Disabler ====
----
'''Gameplay:'''
*Mostly for '''WoE''', okay for BG aswell. Main focus of this build is survivability and to be as annoying as you can get, NOT dealing damage
*Maxed '''Marsh Of Abyss''' to slow down callers, Shadow Chasers and Genetics
*'''Jack Frost/Frost Misty''' for Frozen and Freezing - amazing spam from Poem Of Bragi
*'''Earth Strain''' (from Release) for Full Stripping whole castles
*'''White Imprison''' 5 for stopping single targets (again, Shadow Chasers, Mechanics)
*'''Sienna Execrate''' for petrifying targets (Immunity is rare)
*'''Stasis''' rush into the enemy lines, or during Emperium breaking - a successful Stasis can render whole guilds useless, stopping fights. Avoid using it near your own guild.
*'''Heaven's Drive''' for revealing hidden targets, interrupting calls
*'''Soul Expansion''' + '''Intense Telekinesis''' for breaking Barricades, optional. 
'''Skill build:'''

[[File:MayoStasis.png]]

'''Stat build:'''
*'''STR''' 1-30 - weight limit, status resistances
*'''AGI''' 70-100 - ASPD, status resistances
*'''VIT''' 94+ - stun immunity, bonus HP
*'''INT''' 90+ - cast time, status resistances
*'''DEX''' 120 - for cast time and DEX Temporal bonus
*'''LUK''' 30-60 - status resistances

====The Geomancer ====
----
'''Gameplay:'''
*''This build is focused around the element '''Earth''', highly reliant on gear.''
*Mostly for '''Battlegrounds''', and '''PvP fun, not for competitive use'''. This build is a hybrid disabler/damage dealer, where swapping your items is necessary.
*Maxed '''Marsh Of Abyss''' to slow down and annoy people, mainly Shadow Chasers and Genetics
*'''Jack Frost'''/'''Frost Misty''' for Frozen and Freezing - amazing spam from Poem Of Bragi, AoE Crowd Control
*'''Earth Strain''' (from Release, or Amped) for Full Stripping, and '''secondary damage output'''.
*'''White Imprison''' 5 for stopping single targets, protecting yourself from burst skills such as Asura Strike
*'''Sienna Execrate''' for petrifying targets (Immunity is rare)
*'''Heaven's Drive''' for revealing hidden targets, interrupting calls
*'''Tetra Vortex''' (earth) for nuking low HP single targets. This is your '''main skill to deal damage'''

'''Skill build:'''

= Leveling =
=== Novice ===
*'''Lv 1-17''':
**Talk to the '''Criaturia Academy Staff''' &lt;code>/navi izlude 122/207&lt;/code>, drink the Apple Juice and talk to him again. You will receive EXP.
**Head north, inside the building and register for the academy at the '''Academy Receptionist'''. You will receive EXP and some Potions.
**Exit the building, and find the '''Shop Helper''' outside the Tool Shop &lt;code>/navi izlude 116/181&lt;/code>. Talk to her repeatedly, and finish both of her requests.
**Head to the [[Main Office]], you're now ready to change into '''Magician'''.
=== Magician ===
*'''Lv 17-30''':
**Get your first few job levels around '''Prontera''', by killing Porings/Lunatics/Fabres. Spend them on '''Fire Bolt lv4'''.
**Head to the Eden Group, and pick up the '''Spore Hunting Quest'''. The best map to hunt them is East of '''Payon'''. You should be able to kill them in one '''Fire Bolt'''. Stay here until you have maxed both your '''Fire Ball''' and '''Fire Wall'''
*'''Lv 30-55''':
**Head to the '''Orc Dungeon''', walk around the map and kill groups of '''Orc Zombies''' using your '''Fire Ball''' and '''Fire Wall'''.
***Look out for '''Drainliar's and Orc Skeletons''', they walk faster than the Zombies. When in doubt, use your Fire Wall or a Fly Wing to protect yourself
****Change to '''Wizard''' once you reached ''JobLv 50''

=== Wizard ===
*'''Lv 55-70'''
**Head back to the '''Orc Dungeon''', same tactic as above. 
*'''Lv 70-91'''
**Pick up your [[Eden_Group#Level_70-79|Eden Group Equipment Quest]], for '''Wraiths''' and '''Evil Druids'''. You can also find a turn in board quest for them at the '''Mission [71 - 85]''' Board inside Eden, which is repeatable. ''I recommend staying here until 91, since the 86-91 Turn In quests are not suitable for casters''
***The tactic is the same as it was for Orcs, use your vertical Fire Wall and Fire Ball against them.
****Use Fly Wing if a '''Mimic''' is nearby 
*'''Lv 91-99''': Things get a little slow.
**Pick up the Turn in quests from the '''91-99 Mission Boards''' in '''Eden''', and ''do not turn them in''.
***'''Recommended quests''': '''Solider, Freezer, Injustice, Rybio, Dark Priest, Stapo, Roween, Siroma, Mineral'''
****This part can be ''very difficult without a good graps of Vertical Firewalling.''
=== Rebirth ===
*Once you have reached 99/50, head to the [[Main Office]] and change into '''High Novice'''
**Kill a few Porings or other beginner monsters around Prontera to reach '''JLv 10'''.
*Once you have changed into '''High Magician''', turn in '''one''' of the 91-99 quests you had saved up. This should put you to '''JLv 50'''.
*Change into '''High Wizard''', begin the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautios Village Quest] and turn the 91-99 quests that you saved up in. You should reach, or get close to '''99/70'''.
**If you're missing a few levels, feel free to join any [[Gramps]] parties, continue your 91-99 Turn in Quests, or grind '''Magmarings''' outside Thor Dungeon.
=== Warlock ===
Time to hit up a [[Gramps]] party, or stick to the Eden Boards. You can find the recommend quests below for each board.

You can also try to solo [[Gramps]] once you feel strong enough, depending on the month's rotation. Teleport around, and spam '''Comet''' from books.
*'''Lv 100-110''':
**'''Desert Wolf''': They move relatively slow, you can mob a bunch of them and kill them using your ''Frost Misty + Jack Frost combo''. If you dont have them yet, you can try using Quagmire + Storm Gust on them while standing in Safety Wall. They are fire element.
***Found outside ''Ice Dungeon''
**'''Pinguicula + Luciola Vespa''': Earth/Wind element respectively. I'd recommend grabbing a ''Crimson Rock'' book for instant casting, since they move relatively fast. 
***Found outside ''Splendide.''
**'''Ice Titan + Snowier''': These guys are both Water element, and move really, really slow. You can just Release ''Chain Lightning'', or spam ''Soul Expansion'' and kite them. Spamming Lv10 Jupitel Thunder might work aswell. Look out for Gazetis, they attack from a range with high ASPD. If you happen to encounter them, you can freeze them or just teleport away. They also drop materials for INT and DEX foods, which can get you a little extra money. 
***Found at the ''2nd and 3rd floor of Ice Dungeon''.
*'''Lv 111-120''':
**'''Nepenthes + Centipede Larva''': These guys are both Posion element. '''Nepenthes''' are immovable so you will have no problems, although every other monster on the map is aggressive and moves fast, so it's highly recommended to use ''Safety Wall'' and ''Frost Nova'' if you happen to get mobbed.
***Found just ''East Of Midgard Camp''
**'''Venatu''': This is where things get a little intense. Venatus can be 4 different element, one of them is Water, which can not be frozen. Try mobbing a bunch, use ''Jack Frost'' to freeze them then instantly cast ''Safety Wall'' to protect yourself from the Water ones. After that, cast an Amped Crimson Rock then release another one from book right after. Look out for '''Dimiks''', they might interrupt your casting, so a Phen Card is '''highly''' recommended.
***Found in ''Juperos dungeon''
*'''Lv 121-130'''
**'''Isilla + Vanberk + Hodremlin''': The first two guys pose zero threat since they move really slow. Mob, ''Jack Frost, Crimson Rock'', simple as that. However, Hodremlins are quick, so you might need to use ''Safety Wall'' or ''Fire Wall'' to keep them away from yourself. 
***Found in Rachel Dungeon.
**'''Red Ferus + Green Ferus''': They move really fast, so you will have to rely on Releasing Crimson Rock although fire will not hit the Red one. To hit the Red Ferus, you will need to freeze them first using your Frost Nova/Jack Frost + Crimson Rock combo. And again, do not forget that you have Safety Wall and Frost Nova to protect yourself if they happen to get close. 
***Found in ''Abyss Lake Dungeon''.
*'''Lv 131-140''':
**'''One-Horned, Two-Horned, Rake and Antler Scarabas''': This is where things get a little gear reliant. It is recommended to have fire damage boosting cards/gear, and a Pinguicula card (refer to the Equipment section). The first two guys are passive, but they will get aggressive once one of them is hurt. Safety Wall/Fire Wall, Mystical Amplification, Crimson Rock, and a second, released Crimson Rock if needed. Business as usual.
***Found in ''Scaraba Dungeon''.
*'''Lv 141-175''':
**'''Neo Punk + Big Bell + Big Ben''': Remember how Mages used to level in Clock Tower Pre-Renewal? Well, this is pretty much the same, with higher HP monsters, and instead of Fire Bolt, you use Crimson Rock. The best way to kill these guys is using Vertical Fire Wall + Crimson Rock. If there are any Ridewords or Mimics around, teleport away or simply Safety Wall yourself and kill them.
***Found in ''Nightmare Clock Tower Dungeon''.
