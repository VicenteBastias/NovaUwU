==Overview==
Rune Knights (commonly abbreviated as RK) are the third job of Knights. Like their second job versions, they are known to be both tanky and very offense-oriented, having both a high base MaxHP as well as powerful attack skills. In Renewal, they are most commonly considered as a main damage dealer class, and less commonly as secondary tanks. 

They start out as Swordsmen, which means they have access to useful offensive skills from the beginning, in addition to a decent HP-pool. This makes them fairly easy to level in the early stages. Additionally, they continue being a mainly offensive-type class as they progress, making them a relatively simple class to play, as well.

There are several ways to build an RK, each with their own purposes. This guide will focus on the '''Physical Build''', which revolves around using the RK's offensive skills such as Ignition Break, Hundred Spears, Sonic Wave, and Spiral Pierce; including explanations about stats, skills, equipment choices, and gameplay and leveling tips. 

==Stats==

{| class="wikitable" width="90%"
!style="width:100px"|Stat
!style="width:32%"|Function
!Notes
|-
!STR 
|Increases ATK and Weight Limit.
|The RK's primary stat. This stat is essential for achieving higher damage with auto-attacks as well as physical offensive skills. 

''Recommended amount: 120''
|-
!AGI 
|Increases ASPD and FLEE.

Resistance: Bleeding and Sleep.
|This stat is essential for reaching higher ASPD to allow for quicker skill spamming, which makes it one of the main secondary stats.

Aside from that, it also helps with survivability.

''Recommended amount: 60~100''
|-
!INT 
|Increases MaxSP and SP Regeneration

Reduces Variable Cast Time, Increases MATK.

Resistance: Blind, Sleep, and Silence.
|This stat can be considered tertiary as it doesn't contribute much to your damage. Its main purpose is for your SP upkeep.

Solo players will likely want to get a bit more of this, while players in a party can rely on a Sorcerer or Wanderer for their SP upkeep, without investing too much in INT.

''Recommended amount: 40~100''
|-
!VIT 
|Increases MaxHP and HP regeneration.

Resistance: Blind, Curse, Poison, Silence, and Stun.
|Another tertiary stat. Its main purpose is for survivability, and not much else.

You may want to get a total of 100 VIT for Stun immunity, especially if you're a Solo player. However, you can sometimes get away with having less VIT in party situations.

''Recommended amount: 40~100''
|-
!DEX 
|Increases HIT, reduces Variable Cast Time.

Increases ATK for every 5 point.
|This stat is essential to make sure your attacks actually hit the enemies, which makes it your other secondary stat.

Aside from that, depending on your equipment choices, it also activates some equipment's Ranged Damage bonuses.

''Recommended amount: 60~80, or 120 if using Temporal DEX boots and Menblatt.''
|-
!LUK 
|Increases CRIT, ATK, MATK, and HIT per 3 points

Increases Perfect Dodge per 10 points.

Resistance: Various, minor.
|An almost entirely optional stat for this build. Due to the fact that you'll need to spread your stats pretty thinly in your first 5 stats already, you may not end up being able to take any LUK.

''Recommended amount: Optional''
|-
|}

==Skills==
===First Job===
{|class="wikitable" style="width:100%"
!colspan="2"| Swordsman Skills
|-
!style="width:20%"|Skill !!Description 
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2|url=Sword_Mastery|skill=Sword Mastery}}
|Increases ATK by 4 per skill level when using Sword and Dagger type weapons. ''Passive Skill''

This skill can be useful to get a small ATK boost during early leveling, but it is mostly useless later on as RKs rarely use One-Handed Swords or Daggers. This skill is only needed as pre-requisite.

''Recommended level: 1''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=3|url=Two-Handed_Sword_Mastery|skill=Two-Handed Sword Mastery}}
|Increases ATK by 4 per skill level when using Two-Handed Sword type weapons. ''Passive Skill''

This skill can also be useful during early leveling and while leveling as Knight or Lord Knight, while can provide a small damage boost later on if you're using a Two-Handed Sword type weapon.

This is also a pre-requisite for Bowling Bash, one of Knight's main offensive skills.

''Recommended level: 5 or 10''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=4|url=Increase_HP_Recovery|skill=Increase HP Recovery}}
|Enables a bonus passive HP recovery when not moving, as well as greatly increasing the effectiveness of HP Recovery items. ''Passive Skill''

This is a very very useful skill for an RK's survivability, albeit non-essential in most situations.

''Recommended level: 10''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=5|url=Bash|skill=Bash}}
|Deals up to 400% ATK to a single target in a melee range.

One of the primary offensive skills to use as a Swordsman. At level 6 or higher, it also has a small chance to Stun enemies if the Platinum skill ''Fatal Blow'' is learned.

''Recommended level: 10''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=7|url=Magnum_Break|skill=Magnum_Break}}
|Deals up to 300% Fire-property ATK in a 5x5 AoE around the caster and knocks enemies 2 cells back. Also grants a 20% bonus Neutral-property damage to all attacks for 10 seconds after using the skill.

The other primary offensive skill to use as a Swordsman. The natural fire property makes it very useful for leveling in Undead-populated areas.

''Recommended level: 10''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=6|url=Provoke|skill=Provoke}}
|Attempt to taunt a single target to make it attack you, while reducing its DEF and increasing its ATK. 

An optional skill that is also a pre-requisite for Endure. This is mainly useful for catching aggro from passive monsters.

''Recommended level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=8|url=Endure|skill=Endure}}
|Eliminates the flinching effect when receiving damage for a short duration, allowing the user to move without being slowed down by damage.

A crucial utility skill that is useful for preventing being hit-locked when mobbing or pulling several monsters.

''Recommended level: 10''
|-
|}

===Second Job===
{|class="wikitable" style="width:100%"
!colspan="2"| Knight Skills
|-
!style="width:20%"|Skill !!Description 
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=60|url=Two_Hand_Quicken|skill=Two-Hand Quicken}}
|Boosts ASPD for up to 5 minutes, requires Two-Handed Sword type weapon.

A useful self-buff for leveling during the Knight stage if you are using auto-attacks, and useful later on to boost your ASPD if you're using a Two-Handed Sword type weapon.

This is also a pre-requisite for Bowling Bash

''Recommended level: 10''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=62|url=Bowling_Bash|skill=Bowling Bash}}
|Strikes a single target for up to 500% damage, knocking them back, and inflicts additional damage to them and all enemies in a small area around the target in an instant. Takes 0.7 seconds to cast.

The main offensive skill to use as a Knight as it deals a high enough damage that can easily kill most lower level enemies in 1-2 casts. This skill is preferred over Brandish Spear for its higher damage and no weapon restriction.

''Recommended level: 10''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=63|url=Peco_Peco_Ride|skill=Peco Peco Ride}}
|Enables riding Peco Peco which increases movement speed, increases weight limit by 1000, and eliminates size penalty for Spear-type weapons. Reduces ASPD unless Cavalier Mastery is learned. ''Passive Skill''

This skill is arguably optional, but is still regarded as one of the most important skills for a Knight. The movement speed bonus allows you to move ahead of your party and take enemy aggro before they reach your party mates. This also allows you to outrun most enemies, which makes it easier to pull large mobs without getting attacked.

This skill becomes obsolete and is replaced by Dragon Training when you turn into a Rune Knight.

You can rent a Peco Peco by talking to the Universal Rental NPC available in every town.

''Recommended level: 1''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=64|url=Cavalier_Mastery|skill=Cavalier Mastery}}
|Reduces the ASPD penalty when mounted on a Peco Peco. At level 5, the penalty is eliminated. ''Passive Skill''

This skill is mandatory if you are using a Peco Peco so that you don't suffer from the horrendous ASPD penalty.

''Recommended level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=55|url=Spear_Mastery|skill=Spear Mastery}}
|Increases ATK by 4 per level (5 per level if mounted) when using Spear and Two-Handed Spear type weapons. ''Passive Skill''

This skill is not particularly useful as a Knight as you don't have many good Spear skills yet, but it gives a welcome boost to damage if you're using Spiral Pierce with a Spear or Hundred Spears once you've turned into Lord Knight or Rune Knight.

''Recommended level: 10 or 1''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=59|url=Spear_Boomerang|skill=Spear Boomerang}}
|Deals up to 350% ranged damage to a single target up to 13 cells away. Requires Spear type weapon.

This skill is mainly used for its utility for catching aggro from afar. Coupled with Charge Attack, this skill is very useful for sheltering your party from enemy attacks by catching all their aggros before they get to your party mates.

Keep in mind that this skill can only be used when using Spear type weapon.

''Recommended level: at least 1''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=1001|url=Charge_Attack|skill=Charge Attack}}
|After a brief casting time, moves the user instantly to a target enemy up to 14 cells away, dealing up to 500% damage and knocking the target back a few cells.

Like Spear Boomerang, this skill is mainly for utility rather than damage, allowing you to move rapidly around your party to catch aggro and push enemies back from crucial party members like your healer. 

In NovaRO, this Platinum Skill is automatically learned once you job change into a Knight.

''Recommended level: 1''
|-
|}

===Transcendent===

{|class="wikitable" style="width:100%"
!colspan="2"| Lord Knight Skills
|-
!style="width:20%"|Skill !!Description 
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=355|url=Aura_Blade|skill=Aura Blade}}
|Grants up to 100 bonus Non-Elemental ATK for up to 2 minutes.

This self-buff gives a very significant damage boost, especially during leveling as a Lord Knight and in the early levels as a Rune Knight. It remains as one of your staple self-buffs later in the game as well.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=357|url=Spear_Dynamo|skill=Concentration}}
|Grants up to 25% ATK and 50 HIT while reducing DEF by up to 25% for a short duration, in addition to an ''Endure'' effect.

Similar to Aura Blade, this self-buff gives a significant damage boost, albeit at a shorter duration. This also becomes one of your stable self-buffs later on.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=356|url=Parrying|skill=Parrying}}
|Grants up to 50% chance to block any incoming attack for a duration. Requires Two-Handed Sword type weapon.

This is a very useful skill for improving your survivability if you are using a Two-Handed Sword, especially if you're face-tanking a monster. However, this skill is entirely useless if you're using a different type of weapon.

''Recommended Level: 10 or 0''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=397|url=Spiral_Pierce|skill=Spiral Pierce}}
|After a short cast time, deals a large amount of ranged physical damage to a single target. Damage is based on ATK and is greatly amplified by the user's weapon weight.

This is an insanely powerful skill, arguably one of the strongest offensive skill among transcendent classes. With a heavy weapon and using the right element, you can easily one-shot most regular mobs in your level range. This skill is ideal for leveling as an LK, especially when you're playing solo.

Later on, this skill shines even brighter in party situations, as it becomes spammable under a Bard's Poem of Bragi and Assassin Cross of Sunset, and its damage is greatly boosted by a Maestro/Wanderer's Gloomy Day skill. This makes it an extremely effective skill for killing high-HP Instance bosses.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=358|url=Relax|skill=Tension Relax}}
|Causes the user to sit down and triple their natural HP regeneration while remaining seated. The skill is cancelled when they stand back up.

This is mainly a utility skill for early leveling, albeit not very important in NovaRO since it's easy to just warp back to town and talk to the Healer.

''Recommended Level: Optional''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=359|url=Frenzy|skill=Frenzy}}
|Puts the user in a frenzy status, greatly increasing ATK, ASPD, and Movement Speed while tripling MaxHP and fully replenishing it. Adversely, sets SP to 0, sets DEF and MDEF to 0, disables HP and SP recovery, disables usage of skills, items, switching equipment and chatting, and disallows healing of any kind. 

Consumes 5% HP per 15 seconds while the skill is active, and cancels itself when HP Reaches 100 or less, leaving the user with 100 HP left.

An extreme skill that is mostly used by Critical Builds. However, the inability to cast skills make it non-ideal for the skill-dependant Physical build.

This skill can also be a last-ditch tool for survival, in case your party gets wiped and you're also nearing death. As you cast it and your HP is restored to full, you can lure the boss away from your dead party mates and come back to them. Once the Frenzy ends, you can start reviving your party members and get back into the fight.

''Recommended Level: 1 or 0''
|-
|}

===Third Job===
{|class="wikitable" style="width:100%"
!colspan="2"| Core Skills
|-
!style="width:20%"|Skill !!Description 
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2007|url=Dragon_Training|skill=Dragon Training}}
|Enables riding a dragon mount which increases movement speed, increases weight limit, and eliminates size penalty for Spear-type weapons while increases its damage based on Spear Mastery level. Riding a dragon reduces ASPD by a percentage, but the penalty is eliminated at level 5. Higher levels also boost damage of Dragon Breath and Dragon Water Breath.

This skill replaces Peco Peco Ride and Cavalry Mastery for a Rune Knight. It is highly recommended to take this skill due to the many advantages of riding a dragon.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2001|url=Enchant_Blade|skill=Enchant Blade}}
|Grants a bonus Magical damage based on Skill level, Base Level, and INT to your Auto-Attacks for 6 minutes.

This is a somewhat useful skill early on, but arguably non-essential later on when you rely on your skills more than your auto-attacks. Still, you need to take lv5 as a pre-requisite to your offensive skills.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2006|url=Ignition_Break|skill=Ignition Break}}
|Deals up to 1500% damage to enemies in an 11x11 AoE around the caster. Enemies closest to the caster will take the most damage. This skill's damage is amplified further when using a Fire element weapon.

This is your main AoE Skill, which will be especially useful when leveling as an RK. Later on, this will be used as one of the component of your skill-chaining.

Since this skill only has a Cooldown and no Cast Delay, it can be coupled with Spiral Pierce if under Poem of Bragi, or Bowling Bash if without Bragi.

While the damage does increase when using a Fire element weapon, it's not mandatory to do so. For example, when fighting against Fire element mobs that are resistant or immune to Fire element damage, using a Water or other element weapons will be a better choice.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2004|url=Hundred_Spears|skill=Hundred Spears}}
|Deals up to 1400% ranged damage to a single target with a chance to autocast Spear Boomerang which will knock the target back several cells. Damage is improved when using a weapon with less weight. Requires Spear type weapon.

This is a very powerful single target burst skill that can be used to kill off single targets in one shot. Unlike Spiral Pierce, this skill actually deals ''less'' damage if the weapon is too heavy, therefore a lighter weapon is more suited for this skill.

In addition, this skill has a 3 second hard cooldown, which makes it inferior to Spiral Pierce for sustained damage in party situations. However, this can be used as one of the component of your skill-chaining.

''Recommended Level: 10 or 0''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2002|url=Sonic_Wave|skill=Sonic Wave}}
|Deals up to 1000% ranged damage to a single target up to 11 cells away. The damage is diminished the further the target is.

A powerful skill that can be boosted greatly by certain equipments. Its cooldown also makes it inferior to Spiral Pierce for sustained damage in party situations, but it will be one of the component of your skill-chaining.

''Recommended Level: 5''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2005|url=Wind_Cutter|skill=Wind Cutter}}
|Deals up to 350% damage to enemies in a small AoE in front of the user, knocking them back, and inflicting Fear status at a small chance.

A mostly optional skill as it deals much less damage compared to the other 3 skills above. However, its damage is boosted by the same items that boost Sonic Wave, so you can include it as one of the components in your skill-chaining.

''Recommended Level: Optional''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2020|url=Phantom_Thrust|skill=Phantom Thrust}}
|Deals up to 250% damage to a single target up to 9 cells away while pulling them towards the user. Can be cast on party members without inflicting damage. Requires a Spear type weapon.

This is mainly a utility skill used for either pulling a party member away from danger or pulling a monster away from a party member.

''Recommended Level: Optional''
|-
|{{Skill List2|id=2003|url=Death_Bound|skill=Death Bound}}
|Holds a stance for 3 seconds, during which if an enemy attacks, the damage is amplified and 70% of it is reflected back to the attacker, while the 30% is received by the user.

Not yet tested.
