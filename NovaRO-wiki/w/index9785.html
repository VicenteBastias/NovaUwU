== Overview ==

Hi everyone, Leinarth here. I'm going to teach you what I learned during my stay on NovaRO about Dragon Knights. Here I will teach you about the most interesting builds I have the knowledge of. If there's an acronym you don't understand, you should check out the list I made at the bottom. If you have any questions, you may find me on Novacord under the name Leinarth. Feel free to PM me too, my discord tag is pimousse.

'''Disclaimer: this guide is purely tailored for NovaRO and will not be fit for any other private server, and you may not redistribute it elsewhere, nor use it as a base for your own guide. Seriously, get creative by your own means.'''


[[File:Warning.png]] A bit of news : The arrival of 4th classes and Dragon Knight means a lot of guide updating, for now the stats and skills are done and the gears (and potential builds) will come later.

== Stats ==

*'''STR''' - Strength is crucial for damage, do not neglect it as a RK. It increases a lot Weapon ATK, and RKs mostly play with high ATK weapons like two-handed swords, so it's more than worth it.
*'''AGI''' - Agility should be usually high for all builds (except IB if you can't spam), since you need max ASPD for optimal DPS.
*'''VIT''' - Vitality increases your already great HP pool, don't forget that your HP gets nearly tripled under {{Skill List |id=359 |skill=Berserk |simple=yes}} (Interesting for sustain if you're playing Berserk).
*'''INT''' - Intelligence will increase your Enchant Blade damage, as well as your tiny SP pool. Do not hesitate to put some points here if you feel like you're often out of SP, or you'll have to play with mana potions.
*'''DEX''' - Dexterity is awesome in case you're playing a skill-based build like {{Skill List |id=397 |skill=Spiral Pierce |simple=yes}} or {{Skill List |id=2006 |skill=Ignition Break |simple=yes}}, because you need to reduce the cast as much as possible (Instacasting is great for increasing your DPS).
*'''LUK''' - Luck will be really important if you're playing the Critical build, otherwise it's not something you should focus on.

=== 4th Class Characteristics status ===
*'''POW''' - Power directly impacts physical damage, and is taken into account as a multiplier in several DK skills; it is our main 4th class stat and thus must be maxed, yes even for the Dragon Breath build (more on that later in the Skills section).
*'''STA''' - Stamina increases RES (Physical Resistance), which reduces physical damage taken. This is not really interesting for us as our main concern is dealing damage.
*'''WIS''' - Wisdom increases MRES (Magic Resistance), which reduces magical damage taken. Same as above, none of our concern.
*'''SPL''' - Spell is the magic version of POW, and since we don't do any magic damage, we also ignore this stat.
*'''CON''' - Concentration is kind of the 4th class version of LUK as it increases various stats (HIT, FLEE, P.ATK and S.MATK). If you go for a non-critical build, this will be your second main stat.
*'''CRT''' - Creative is a weird stat which increases both the 40% base Critical Damage modifier (not the same mod as what we get from gears) and... H.PLUS for better heals. Forget that last part and pick up this stat as your second main one if you wish to go for a Critical build.

== Skills ==

Here we'll talk about what to level up in your skill trees, what skills are important; I'll give you what I leveled up but feel free to change it to your liking. This skill build is a versatile build intended to be used for all builds except the dragon skills, so this list might not be what you're looking for if you're going down the Dragon Breath path.

| {{Skill List |id=2 |skill=Sword Mastery Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| Increases ATK with daggers and one-handed swords. You only need this at level 1 to unlock 2HS Mastery; there's no one-handed sword or dagger that are worth it for RKs (maybe you'll take it if you plan on use something like Combat Knife on a Dragon Breath PVP build, or if you're going on a meme adventure with Faceworm Queen's Leg and a full int build ?).
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3 |skill=Two-Handed Sword Mastery Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Some free ATK once you get a 2HS like Lindy Hop (RK's best sword &lt;del>waifu&lt;/del> fellow), good enough.
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|-
| {{Skill List |id=7 |skill=Magnum Break Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| It pushes back all enemies around you, deals Fire property damage in a 5x5 AoE, and it gives you a temporary 20% Fire damage boost based on your ATK. You need this at level 5 for Aura Blade when you get Lord Knight, and lvl 3 for Bowling Bash as a Knight.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List |id=4 |skill=Increase HP Recovery Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Gives higher HP recovery and increases the regeneration you get from consumables, always nice to have, especially when you have the platinum skill Moving HP Recovery.
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5 |skill=Bash Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Your main single target spamming skill as a Swordsman, it deals up to 400% damage based on your ATK and has the ability to stun with the platinum skill Fatal Blow. You can get a Bongun card if you want to go trolling in PvP with this and Charge Attack for maximum pushback.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|- 
| {{Skill List |id=6 |skill=Provoke Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This skill decreases the defense of the enemy while increasing his attack; this skill is mainly used for luring mobs since they'll target you once you Provoke them. You need it at level 5 for both Endure as a Swordsman and Parry as a Lord Knight.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=8 |skill=Endure Lv 8 |simple=yes}}
| With this you won't get anim-locked for up to 7 hits, great to use when you need to get out of a mess or you're making a mob train. It also increases MDEF by a tiny bit.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|- 
| {{Skill List|id=146 |skill=Auto Berserk Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| This skill does a reduced version of Provoke on yourself; it gives a neat 32% ATK boost in exchange for a 55% decrease of your soft DEF; You can keep it always activated for instances/MvPs, since you don't have any DEF under Berserk anyway.

[[File:Warning.png]] You won't be able to take all these skills as a Knight/Lord Knight ! I used some of my Rune Knight points into my 2nd class tree because I don't play Dragon Breath build, and most of the RK skills do not interest me except some of them that I'll explain in the Third Job Skills section.

| {{Skill List |id=60 |skill=Two-Hand Quicken Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| The sweet melody of good ol' AGI knight buddy comes from this skill. It used to be a +30% ASPD bonus but since Renewal it has become a +7 flat ASPD bonus which lasts 300 seconds. You need this skill maxed first to be able to kill monsters quickly without relying on SP consumables. Don't forget to get the ASPD potion corresponding to your level for maximum sword-spamming in the enemies' faces. '''Since the KRO Mass Skill Rebalance, this skill now gives in addition to the usual buff, +10% ASPD, and Crit and HIT per skill level, to a maximum of Crit + 12 and  HIT + 20'''.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List |id=61 |skill=Auto Counter Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This makes you wait for an attack during the whole cast of the skill; if you get attacked in front of your character, the attack will be blocked and you'll automatically counter with a hit. This skill might have been useful in pre-renewal but it's not the case anymore. You need to level it up to 5 to unlock Bowling Bash.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List |id=62 |skill=Bowling Bash Lv 0 (or 10) |simple=yes}}
| This skill is great for killing monsters in AoE, &lt;del>though it gets sometimes another behaviour where only the monster you clicked on will get damaged and it'll get pushed bash far away; this is due to the gutterlines problem (Use your Google-fu and check it out if you don't know it)&lt;/del>. '''Since the KRO Mass Skill Rebalance, there's no gutterline anymore, it has a 1 second cooldown and deals more damage with a two-handed sword.''' On my current build I don't have it because I do not use it anymore (as a crit RK you mainly do single target DPS), to allow for more diversity in my build like the possibility of getting Spiral Pierce and a Peco Peco/Dragon. If you are leveling, you should of course take it for faster grinding.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List |id=63 |skill=Riding Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| You have the possibility of walking 25% faster as well as having 1k added to your maximum weight capacity so of course you should take it (Except if you want to be the edgy RK walking slowly away from your victims).
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|-
| {{Skill List |id=64 |skill=Cavalry Mastery Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| If you take a mount, obviously you need this or you'll hit slower than a Novice lvl 1. You need it at level max to prevent losing ASPD when you get a mount. Once you are a Rune Knight, you don't need this skill anymore except for the requirement on Dragon Training, so only get it level 1 when that time comes.
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|- 
| {{Skill List |id=55 |skill=Spear Mastery Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Works the same as the two previous masteries you can get as a Swordsman, but for spears (both one-handed and two-handed). You need it at level max to unlock Spiral Pierce once you get Lord Knight, if you're only a Knight don't bother with spear skills like this one, except if you have a really good spear you can use.
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=56 |skill=Pierce Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This skill was mostly used in pre-renewal for leveling with a spear on large monsters, because it can deal its damage several times depending on the size of the monster (1 hit for small, 2 for medium, 3 for large monsters). Same as before, take it if you have a good spear or simply because you want to play a spear Knight build for leveling on large monsters. You need it at level 5 to unlock Spear Stab.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|- 
| {{Skill List|id=58 |skill=Spear Stab Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This skill is unused by the majority of the spear users, because it does mediocre damage and you usually don't want to push back the enemies you want to fight. Even though it's crap, you must get it to level 5 to unlock Spiral Pierce, once you're a Lord Knight.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|- 
| {{Skill List|id=57 |skill=Brandish Spear Lv 2 |simple=yes}}
| Brandish Spear is an alternative to Bowling Bash for spear users; I personally don't use it but some people prefer using this for leveling instead of BB. I only get it level 2 to unlock the RK's skill Phantom Thrust. '''Brandish Spear is now a ranged skill since the KRO Mass Skill Rebalance, and its damage depends a lot on your STR.'''
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|- 
| {{Skill List|id=59 |skill=Spear Boomerang Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| Spear Boomerang is optional, you can take it if you decide to have a multi-purpose build like me; I can take it thanks to the skill points I do not use for Bowling Bash since I don't use it anymore, and it adds a small amount of damage to the skill Hundred Spear (there's a 40% chance of casting it instantly after H-Spear Lv 10). If you will never use spears, you may redistribute these points somewhere else.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive

'''Transcended Job Skills'''
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 28% "| Skill
! style=" width: 72% "| Notes
! style=" width: 20% "| Type
|-
| {{Skill List|id=355 |skill=Aura Blade Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| Aura Blade &lt;del>gives +100 ATK on your attacks and it's unaffected by your enemies' DEF&lt;/del> '''now gives flat damage based on your level (kRO MSR)'''. You know the drill, free ATK buffs' are always nice to have.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=356 |skill=Parrying Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| This skill is really awesome for surviving as a two-handed sword user; it allows you to parry physical attacks at a whooping 50% chance at level max, it's like Auto Guard but much better. You can even tank several physical skills like Asura Strike or Spiral Pierce with it. Be careful though, it only lasts 60 seconds so don't forget to keep it always active, and also cast it before you use Berserk so you don't suffer too much early from your lack of DEF.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=357 |skill=Concentration Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| For a short duration, Concentration further increases the power of the madman you are; it gives you +50 HIT, increases your ATK by 25% and decreases your DEF by 25% (who cares about DEF when you can hit like a truck ? ;D). It also gives you the effect of Endure for a small duration, and you can reset the 7 hits by using Endure after.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=358 |skill=Tension Relax Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| This skill is optional as it is quite oriented for solo grinding; it triples your HP recovery speed and makes you sit down, but if anything happens to you (that includes taking damage, standing up, using consumables, equipping stuff), the buff is canceled. You may take it if you play often solo, do not use HP items and have points to spend on your LK skill tree.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=359 |skill=Berserk Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| Now we're talking ! Berserk is pretty much the bread and butter of the Crit RK; you won't be able to do anything than attacking your enemies without skills, but you'll have :
*Full recovery of your HP
*HP tripled
*Double damage
*+15% ASPD
*Endure effect
*Increased movespeed
*Flee halved
*DEF/MDEF reduced to 0
It also drains your HP by 5% every 15 seconds, so don't forget to fall back once you get really low, that way you can wait for the effect to end, resplenish your SP to buff yourself again, Berserk again and get back into the fight. If the fight ends before your Berserk does, you can ask a Sorcerer to use Dispell on you or an AB to use Clearance (Use chatrooms/emoticons to talk in Berserk). Also, please do not forget that you can't level the skill until you're job 50 as a Lord Knight.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=397 |skill=Spiral Pierce Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This is the strongest offensive skill you unlock as a Lord Knight. It has proven itself back in pre-renewal in PvP and WoE as a frightening skill that could one shot lots of classes without enough PvP-tanking stuff, because it ignores Soft and Hard DEFs. It's still great in Renewal, and it's especially strong if you make your build based on this skill; % ranged damage bonuses and DEX will be this skill's friends.
'''With the kRO MSR, Spiral Pierce's cast time has been quite reduced, both in FCT and VCT, as well as the After Cast Delay which got halved. The skill's special size penalty got improved and now the damage formula also depends on BASE LEVEL.'''
Here's the old formula of the skill, taken from RMS (to give you an idea of how it works) :
* &lt;code>Damage = [(80% of weapon's weight * (100%+ skill level*50%) + (round.down(STR/10^2) + Upgrade Damage) * size modifier (S 125%, M 100%, L 75%)) * card factors * element factors ]* 5 hits&lt;/code>
To summarize it up with the factors that increase its damage:
*+% ranged damage bonus
*Weight of your weapon
*STR
*+% damage cards
*Elemental advantage
*Base Level
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=398 |skill=Head Crush Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| It used to be nice in pre-renewal because it allowed you to bleed enemies to death, since not everybody had high VIT and LUK (for the bleeding success rate, it's not the same as External Bleeding); but with third classes pretty much everybody has put a lot of points into these stats. Don't bother leveling it.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=399 |skill=Joint Beat Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| This skill can do a lot of different strong status alignements on enemies, but it's highly impeded by Hard DEF (comes from VIT). Same as Head Crush, it was good back in pre-renewal, don't level it.

| {{Skill List|id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Basically the reason why you're called a Rune Knight, it allows you to create the runes you can consume as a RK. Each level unlocks a rune, and also increases the success rate of the crafting (starts at a 53% base rate and stops at a 71% base rate) so you should get it level max. The most important runes you should try to get are Turisus (Giant Growth), Asir (Fighting Spirit) and Rhydo (Crush Strike). The other runes are situational, you should first focus on creating a big supply of these 3 as you'll be keeping them up everytime because of how strong they are (except Rhydo, you should keep them for big monsters or when you need to end quickly a fight).

If you want to know more about the runes, you should check out the section dedicated for it [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Leinarth%27s_Rune_Knight_Class_Guide#How_to_become_a_Rune_Craftsman_101 here].

|| {{Skill List|id=2001 |skill=Enchant Blade Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| This skill allows you to add your MATK as additional magic damage to your normal attacks, and it adds 200 MATK during the duration. This means you can directly add stat points into INT for damage, although some tests have shown that the upgrade in damage is quite small (Somebody tested the impact of MATK and saw a difference of 2-3K damage between 1 and 90 INT). Despite this, you should take it because for early game it'll give you a slight advantage on your normal attacks and later on it'll be useful for a shadow gear equipment that gives ASPD based on this skill.

|-
| {{Skill List|id=2002 |skill=Sonic Wave Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| It's a quick ranged attack pretty useful early on for farming little monsters (especially if you have a Peuz set). It is one of the several builds possible on RK as this skill has great potential with its ability to crit and also the fact that there is an endgame weapon that heavily reduces the cooldown of it, making it spammable and damn strong.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2003 |skill=Death Bound Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This skill is an evolution of Auto Counter, and not a good skill to get in my opinion. Waiting for an enemy to strike has never been good in RO and will never be (except if we one day get Max Pain as a skill but that will never happen). We get it level 5 to unlock {{Skill List |id=2006 |skill=Ignition Break |simple=yes}}.
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2005 |skill=Wind Cutter Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This is a self-target AoE skill that hits everything around you up to 7x7 cells with a small cooldown 0.35 seconds at level 5. The skill has different mechanics depending on the weapon you use :
*With a two-handed sword : 2 hits instead of 1 hit, at a 1250% per hit skill modifier, and the skill will pierce DEF
*With a spear weapon : the damage is considered ranged instead of melee, with a 2000% skill modifier
*With other weapons : nothing specific, with a 1500% skill modifier
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2006 |skill=Ignition Break Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This is one of the big ATK AoE skills of the Rune Knight, it now deals 2000% ATK on an entire area of 9x9 cells around you, and will apply critical hits. It has a cooldown that makes it kinda slow to use but later on there are several gears to reduce it eventually to 0, making it spammable (but also extremely expensive).
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2020 |skill=Phantom Thrust Lv 3 |simple=yes}}
| This spear-only skill can bring your enemies (or allies) next to you, as well as attacking them (not to allies of course). It has a range of 7 cells at level 3, and you can use it either to save an ally who went too far into the battlefield or to troll party members (you might get kicked of the party for that, be careful).
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2004 |skill=Hundred Spear Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| A spear exclusive skill pretty strong and extremely fast to cast which hits in a 7x7 AoE from afar; it has some CD that can be nearly completely removed through some gears to allow some spam.

| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2007 |skill=Dragon Training Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| This skill is the same as Riding&amp;Cavalry Mastery, you'll need it if you got these two, RKs can't ride Peco-Pecos anymore because they're "afraid" of the mana that emanates from the RKs (RP reason outta nowhere of why the devs were too lazy to make two mount sprites).
| style="background:#cccccc;text-align:center" | Passive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| This is a strong dragon skill that does ranged, Fire, AoE damage that ignores flee and may cause the Burning effect. It's mainly used in its own build: it's quite good when you get DEX Temporal Boots and a way to reduce After Cast Delay like Tae Goo Lyeon or the Excellion set. This build is too much specialized in stat investment and stuff so I didn't invest points into it. '''Runes can enchant your Dragon Breath with different elements ! Use Turisus to make it Holy element, and Lux Anima to change it to Shadow element (Lux takes priority over Turisus).'''
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=5004 |skill=Dragon's Water Breath Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| It's the same as the previous one, except it does Water damage instead and may inflict the Freezing status. '''Same as for Dragon Breath, you can enchant this skill with different elements, including Ghost property if you use the Asir runestone, and Neutral property if you use Lux Anima (Lux takes priority over Asir).'''
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=2007 |skill=Dragon Howling Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| Dragon Howling causes the Fear status with a high success rate (80% at level 10) in a big area around the caster (15x15 at level 10), thus immobilizing them momentarily. This skill is nice for luring monsters and packing them at one place, either to kill them with Dragon Breath or to allow your team to deal with them efficiently. I never use this skill but depending on your gameplay you might find it quite useful, even if you don't play DB build (especially for PvP content).
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=5014 |skill=Full Throttle Lv 0 or 5 |simple=yes}}
| Full Throttle is a skill common to all 3rd classes that restores your life to the max, increases your stats by 20% temporarily while consuming a percentage of your max HP every second. Despite the fact that it seems really strong, you get a cooldown of 30 minutes on the skill, and at the end of the duration you'll get the Rebound status and become literally crippled; your movement speed decreases and your natural HP and SP recoveries are disabled. If you have skill points to spend, you should get it to level max or not at all because the first levels are pretty much crap. It can help you in a difficult situation if you're not under Berserk, or you can use it BEFORE Berserk to go fully on the offensive and hope you don't die before both the skill and Berserk's HP consumptions alongside the enemies' attacks slaughter you. If you end up leveling it, keep it for the MvPs.

| {{Skill List|id=5201 |skill=Servant Weapon Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| The first and core skill of the Servant Weapon branch, it allows you to summon continuously for a specific duration up to 5 floating swords which can be used either for boosting AA attacks with some bonus 9x9 splash (halved) critical damage (which is influenced also by your base level and your POW stat), or consume them with the other Servant skills.

| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=5204 |skill=Servant Weapon - Phantom Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| The third skill of the Servant branch, it will make the user dash to the Sign-marked target and inflict damage to the target and around it in a 5x5 AoE, with a number of hits equal to the current quantity of summoned weapons available. This skill scales on base level, POW and critical damage, with a normal critical chance. It has a high chance of inflicting the Pitch-Darkness status (Unknown on what it does for now).
| style="background:#ffcccc;text-align:center" | Offensive
|-
| {{Skill List|id=5205 |skill=Servant Weapon - Demolition Lv 3 |simple=yes}}

This skill scales on base level, POW and critical damage, with a normal critical chance. It also recovers 3 AP.

|-
| {{Skill List|id=5206 |skill=Charging Pierce Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| A buff skill exclusive to spears and two-handed sword users, it allows the player to stack "Charging counter" charges when using Pierce/Spiral Pierce/Hundred Spears/Madness Crusher. These charges last for 5 seconds and if no charging skill is cast within 5 seconds, the stacks will be reset.

|-
| {{Skill List|id=5208 |skill=Hack and Slasher Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| Exclusive to two-hand sword/spear users, this targeted skill deals 2-hits AoE damage on the target and enemies around it up to a maximum of 9x9 range depending on the skill level.

|-
| {{Skill List|id=5213 |skill=Storm Slash Lv 5 |simple=yes}}

It can crit (with a normal crit rate) and is influenced by base level and POW, and there is also a chance of doing double damage while under the influence of Giant Growth (Turisus Runestone). This skill also recovers 1 AP per cast.

| {{Skill List|id=5212 |skill=Vigor Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| One of the two ultimate skills of Dragon Knights which can be casted for 150 AP, Vigor heavily increases the damage of basic auto attacks for 5 minutes, while also increasing a lot damage against Demi-Human and Angel enemies. This great boost comes with a downside of consuming a small amount of HP on every attack.
| style="background:#ccffcc;text-align:center" | Active
|-
| {{Skill List|id=5210 |skill=Dragonic Aura Lv 0 |simple=yes}}
| The other ultimate Dragon Knight skill which can also be casted for 150 AP, Dragonic Aura inflicts a very strong ranged attack (strangely ATK% based, and influenced by base level and POW) upon a single target, with a higher percentage if the target is Demi-Human or Angel. After casting it, the user will also deal increased damage with the 3rd class Dragon Breath skills and Hundred Spears during 300 seconds.

=== Rune Activation Trivia ===
----

There are some quite rare cases where the rune fails and you won't get buffed. The success rate formula (considering {{Skill List |id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery |simple=yes}} is Lv10) is the following:

&lt;code>[60 + Skill_Lv + (DEX + LUK) √∑ 20]%&lt;/code>

Thankfully, it doesn't happen often as we have by default a very high success rate (95% if you have {{Skill List |id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery |simple=yes}} at Lv 10 and 1 in both DEX and LUK). Here is a list of what could happen if you failed the consumption of your rune:

{|class=wikitable
!Effect
!Chance
!Details
|-
|Nothing
|80%||Nothing but confusion about what happened to your missing rune buff.
|-
|Status Effect
|10%||What an unlucky fellow ! You get "blessed" with one of the following status effects: Blind, Silence, Sleep, Poison, Stun, and Frozen.
|-
|Explosion
|3%||I hope you didn't cast while being at low HP... The rune blows up, dealing you &lt;code>(Rune_Weight √ó 1000)&lt;/code> magic damage.
|-
|Recovery
|3%||This rune had an identity problem, and behaved like a Red Potion. It heals you for &lt;code>(Rune_Weight √ó 1000)&lt;/code> HP.
|-
|Teleport
|2%||Why would you buy Fly Wings when you have runestones ? You get teleported to another location on the map.
|-
|Full Recovery
|1%||You crush the rune, only to discover that it was in reality an Yggdrasil Berry. You get a full recovery !
|-
|Mass Resurrection
|1%||This rune felt like your party members didn't deserve their death, and resurrects them all (you're really lucky if it happens, this is about a 100 times harder to proc than dropping an MvP card).
|}

If at some point it looks like your runes have no effect, '''please make sure your {{Skill List |id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery |simple=yes}} skill is leveled (and obviously maxed out) ! It directly impacts the effectiveness of your runes !'''


=== Rune Crafting ===
----

Now it's time for the crafting part; we're going to see how it works, and how you can craft the most runes.

The success formula is :
&lt;code>[Base_Success_Rate + (DEX √∑ 30 + LUK √∑ 10 + JobLv √∑ 10) + Runestone_Bonus - Rune_Rank]%&lt;/code>

Base_Success_Rate goes from 32% at {{Skill List |id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery |simple=yes}} Lv1, up to 50% at Lv10. So to get the best crafting rate, always make sure you got the skill maxed out. Keep in mind also that it affects directly the efficiency of the runes; if you have {{Skill List |id=2010 |skill=Rune Mastery |simple=yes}} at a very low level or not even leveled at all, your runes will be extremely weak !

If you're playing a Critical Rune Knight build, you may notice that it's much easier for you to craft them thanks to the high investment in the LUK stat. Otherwise if you're playing another build or simply want to minmax, you might want to register a crafting build with 130 DEX, 130 LUK, at the Build Manager in the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Main_Office Main Office] to get the highest success rate possible.

The Rune_Rank penalty depends on the runestone you're crafting, it goes from 5% up to 20%, so as a rule of thumb, always keep the 20% penalty in your calcuations if you make a crafting build. Some people have reported having a better success chance increased their numbers of crafted runes, others said it was purely random, '''needs to be tested thorougly.'''

To complete the formula, you'll need the success bonus from the rough runestone consumables, you can find it here :

You'll also see that on the Rune Knight NPC's shopwindow in the Main Office, in addition to the roughstones he also sells Elder Branch, Light Granule and Gold. These are pretty expensive and you should always try to farm the components or at least always look up the price on the market, otherwise you will waste often a lot of money in the long run if you're lazy &lt;del>like me&lt;/del>. Many thanks to Willi for sharing his farming spots !

== Basic Equipment ==
Here we'll see some basic stuff you can find on the floor at Prontera if you're lucky at that time or at a small price in the market (watch out for rip-offs !). There will be also mid-game equipment, and a few end-game items. '''Please do not forget that if you are a total beginner and the equipments feel unobtainable at first on the market, you can keep playing with the Eden Gears until a higher level like 150 as they are reliable enough if you do all the quests at the Eden HQ, considering there are progression gears even for after level 99.

It can be quite hard if you're a beginner so check the market to see if you can find the equipments there instead.

|-

If you don't know them, Essences of Evil (more commonly known as EoE) are card-like items that you can put anywhere, regardless of the item. You can get them in the instance [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Temple_of_the_Demon_God Temple of the Demon God]. These "cards" give bonuses based on their stat name, but they'll also decrease another stat. There's also 3 versions of each "stat card", the third one giving the biggest bonus (and it's also the most expensive one). If you aim for a budget build, you can get EoE 1 or 2 as they're usually incredibly cheap on the market.

||STR+4, ATK+12, INT-4
||{{ws|id=4910}}
||This is neat for getting more flat ATK, useful when you don't have anything you find useful to put in some slots like the headgears, the boots or you simply don't want to spend too much money on Gold Scaraba Cards for your accessories.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=4916 |item=Essence of Evil AGI 3 |simple=yes}}
||AGI+4, Flee+8, VIT-4
||{{ws|id=4916}}
||In case you were really craving for more AGI,you can get this EoE to help you achieving that sweet 193 maximum attack speed. Be careful though, this will decrease your VIT so if you were planning to get stun immunity, you might need to reset your stats to put more points there.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=4919 |item=Essence of Evil VIT 3 |simple=yes}}

|-
||{{Item List2 |id=4922 |item=Essence of Evil DEX 3 |simple=yes}}
||DEX+4, HIT+8, LUK-4
||{{ws|id=4922}}
||This EoE will only be useful in case you're going for a instant cast build like Spiral Pierce, because you'll need a LOT of DEX to complete the IC formula (INT+DEX*2=530).
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=4925 |item=Essence of Evil LUK 3 |simple=yes}}
||LUK+4, Critical+4, DEX-4
||{{ws|id=4925}}
||You'll probably need this if you're aiming for 100% critical chance (without considering the critical defense of the enemies of course). If you're pretty close to 100 in Critical, you can forget about putting points in DEX as you'll be most of the time doing critical hits, which have perfect hit and aren't affected by your HIT rate (and this also means that the decrease in DEX of the EoE does nothing to you, so it's basically a win-win situation for you).

||If your build is focused on spamming a skill and there's an ACD on it, this might be really good at +6 or +9 because it decreases your casting delay and your SP consumption. It starts at -5% Cast Delay and -10% SP Consumption, and is usually refined till +9 where it gives -14% Cast Delay and -19% SP Consumption.

||This hat will be great if you plan on playing a DB build or spear build (Spiral or HS) as it's a really good investment, the only hat that gives a bit more %ranged damage costs about 500M (The increase in damage is not worth it in my opinion) whereas this one costs about ~25M depending on the rate of the {{NShop}} reseller.

|-
||{{Card |id=4412 Marduk Card}}
||Card
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1140/marduk Marduk]

|-
||{{Card |id=4411 Vanberk Card}}
||Card
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1771/vanberk Vanberk]

Don't worry about the small chance, it still happen often; 0.5% on each hit you do can happen much more frequently than you might think.

||Good overall armor, it will take advantage of your INT in case you leveled it up a bit because it autocasts Heal and Storm Gust lvl 10 when you physically attack. Be careful though, the Storm Gust autocast might be more bothering than useful if you kill monsters one by one, since it keeps moving your enemies around.

||{{Item List2 |id=15066 |item=Engraved Armor |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

||Engraved Armor is really nice because it'll give you a big +25 MDEF and it has one of the highest DEF rates. It's very useful since the MATK formula update for monsters, to lessen the pain you get from the monsters who use strong magic (Golden Scaraba... oof).
|-
||{{Card |id=4337 Porcellio Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1699/porcellio Porcellio]
||This card gives +25 ATK and -5 DEF. It emphasizes again on the all-out strategy where you don't care about your defense; if you play with a two-handed sword and use Parrying, this will not be a problem.
|-
||{{Card |id=4387 Ancient Mimic Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1699/ancient-mimic Ancient Mimic]
||If you're playing on the critical build and you have trouble getting max ASPD or you want to spend less points into AGI, you can get this card since you'll have 120 LUK (because of the Temporal Boots of Luck) and get +6 AGI.

||A 200 ATK two-handed sword with a rare capacity of 3 slots that gives you a small ATK bonus (+20) if you have 96 STR or more. This could prove to be a good alternative to other 2HS because of the versatility of the 3 slots; you could put a Hunter Fly card for life stealing and still keep 2 ~20% damage cards (like Hydra, Skeleton Worker, White Knight).
|-

||In the hidden room of [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim]
||A 330 ATK two-handed sword made for full offensive, equipping it will give you +20 STR. Also, its weapon level is 1, so you can safely refine it to +7 (but it won't make a big difference since lvl 1 weapons don't get as much bonus as lvl 3 and 4).
|-

||This sword is quite interesting if you manage to get it with the Fire element; it will increase your Ignition Break damage by +50%, making this skill quite effective for killing mob trains. Most monsters in endgame content are weak to Fire, so your damage should increase decently.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=1186 |item=Death Guidance |slots=2 |simple=yes}}

||A 200 ATK two-handed sword that give you a lot of survival capacity; it gives you +20 Perfect Dodge and the possibility to do an AoE life steal when you physically attack. Watch out for the Hell Power that you can sometimes autocast on yourself, it'll prevent you from being resurrected for several minutes.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=21009 |item=Thanatos Great Sword |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Ghost_Palace Ghost Palace]
||This two-handed sword is really nice for survival because it gives you a chance to regenerate a small part of the damage you do on a attack, including AoE attacks. It's really strong on Ignition Break and Dragon Breath builds; if you have a Rideword Hat and a Hunter Fly Card in your weapon you'll regenerate lots of HP quite often. Since the new Ghost Palace update, you can also enchant your Thanatos weapon, you can get nice effects like an elemental enchantment (they're similar to Vicious Mind enchantments).

||Tae Goo Lyeon is a weapon mostly used for end-game Dragon Breath build because of its bonuses when refined at +9; your cast delay between skills gets reduced by 20%, same thing for your SP consumption. You'll even be able to enchant it with %ranged damage twice (Expert Archer enchantment).

||One of the famous crimson weapons. The base ATK is low but it'll get much stronger thanks to the special ATK bonus that increases each time you refine it, up to +15. It's a very interesting choice thanks to its element option, it allows you to disregard element enchant consumables or skills, making it a good investment if you plan on staying in a place for a long time (Fire-enchanted for Scaraba Hole, Holy-enchanted for Gefenia, OGH, Ghost Palace....).

||Pretty much the same as the spear, but this one is two-handed and has more weight; it's more offensive-oriented (since you can't use a shield anymore) and is a better choice for Spiral Pierce than the spear if you want to stay in the crimson weapons.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=1466 |item=Crescent Scythe |slots=0 |simple=yes}}

||You want to do a critical build but you're too poor to afford big critical bonus items ? Fear not, the Crescent Scythe is here for you with its whooping +30 critical ! But be careful if you're going to use Turisus Rune as it'll enable the possibility of breaking your weapon, and this one isn't indestructible. You might want to try slotting the weapon, and in case you manage to get a Crescent Scythe slotted, put a Golem Card inside to have an indestructible weapon and forget about the possibility of breaking your item.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=16033 |item=Robot's Mechanical Arm |slots=2 |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/3124/charleston-3 Charleston 3]
||It's about the same as the previous one but there are some differences: first of all it's a mace so it's an indestructible weapon (special property of all maces), it has 2 slots whereas the Crescent Scythe doesn't have one by default (and can only get one if you manage to slot it), and the critical bonus is smaller (20 instead of 30). You'll also have a much better ASPD with it since it's a one-handed mace (the previous weapon is a two-handed spear). It used to be my main weapon when I started my RK career, because of how good and underrated it is.
|-

||The reason why you would want to go for this weapon is either because you have one with a good elemental advantage (Fire and Holy are great) and refined +7 or more (otherwise you'd probably better off with a Robot's Mech Arm +7~), either it's simply refined past +10 and you wish to make use of it (even if it has a useless element like Poison).
|-
||{{Card |id=4072 Golem Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1040/golem Golem]
||You'll get a small ATK bonus (+5) and the indestructible property on your weapon. Very useful if you wish to use Turisus and Rhydo runes and your weapon is not indestructible by default.
|-
||{{Card |id=4140 Abysmal Knight Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1219/abysmal-knight Abysmal Knight]
||This is the card you'll probably want to use if you plan on killing MvPs since it gives +25% damage against bosses. Because Geffenia is a common farming map, you can get this card really cheap ! A good choice for MvP beginners.
|-
||{{Card |id=4518 Banaspaty Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/2154/banaspaty Banaspaty]
||Banaspaty isn't the usual card you would expect on a weapon but it has already proved its worth on high HP enemies. It only works on normal monsters, boss monsters are immune to the Burning status.
|-
||{{Card |id=4115 Hunter Fly Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1035/hunter-fly Hunter Fly]
||If you plan on defeating all your enemies by grouping them up together and using AoE attacks, this is for you. Hunter Fly Card allows you to regenerate health based on the damage you deal, at a low chance. Hitting more monsters means you're repeating the probability several times, and it ramps up the chance of making the card proc; add this card to a Thanatos Weapon and use a Rideword and you'll notice you get full health in no time while killing monsters, basically making you unstoppable machine that does not need a support or potions. The skills you would want to use with this combo, are Ignition Break, Bowling Bash, Magnum Break and the Storm Blast rune (this means using a consumable (the rune) but it's freaking strong).
|-
||{{Card |id=27184 Knight Sakray Card}}
||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Ghost_Palace Ghost Palace]
||The chance of you using this card is pretty low simply because there aren't a lot of them on the server since it's quite new, they are currently expensive, but you could theorically get them for free if you farm Ghost Palace daily (you need 10,000 Gray Shards). It's one of the best card you can have for an evil cleansing purpose as it gives a neat ATK bonus and a big 30% increase in damage against Undeads and Demons.

||{{Card |id=4608 White Knight Card}}
||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim]
||This card IS the meta card for all physical damage dealers. It gives a 20% physical damage increase against medium and large monsters (most of the monsters you'll encounter mid to late game) and a small ATK bonus. If you're playing any one-handed weapon, you might want to get the combo with Khalitzburg Knight card which does the same in the defensive category, and getting the set will give you another 15% increase in damage. They cannot be dropped, but they can be crafted at the entrance of the instance Old Glast Heim against drops of the instance (it's much easier to create them with loots of the Hard Mode).

||{{Item List2 |id=2122 |item=Platinum Shield |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1829/sword-master Sword Guardian]
||This shield doesn't have a slot, but it does a 15% reduction effective for most enemies (Medium and Large) and also 10% reduction against Undead monsters (the race, not the element). It's also great for fighting against magic, because it gives a small +5 MDEF bonus and also a 15% chance to get Magic Mirror for 2 seconds (40% chance to reflect magic attacks) everytime you're magically attacked.

|-

||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1268/bloody-knight Bloody Knight]
||If you are getting knocked away by skills like Jupitel Thunder too often and you hate it, you might want to take a look at this shield. This is a shield that gives you immunity to Knockback, but it'll increase all the damage you receive by 20%; you should try to get a card that compensates the damage amplification like Khalitzburg Knight Card or Hodremlin Card.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=2115  |item=Valkyrja's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1765/valkyrie Valkyrie]
||It's the favourite shield of a lot of PvP players, mainly because it gives a 20% damage reduction against Fire, Water, Shadow and Undead properties, and it used to be pretty much the best shield back in Pre-Renewal. If you need survivability against monsters that use nasty magic skills like Dark Soul Strike or Dark Grand Cross, this shield will be pretty neat.
|-
||{{Card |id=4413 Hodremlin Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1773/hodremlin Hodremlin]
||This card gives a 15% physical reduction against all sizes so it's great if you only want to keep one shield. There's also supposed to be a chance to get +30 Perfect Dodge during 10 seconds, but I've heard that this was currently not working, if you feel like this is important, you should make a suggestion on the forum to remind our dear developpers about the issue or post on a already existing topic about it.

|-
||{{Card |id=4045 Horn Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1128/horn Horn]
||If you don't mind switching your stuff often, getting a Horn Card is great when you're up against ranged monsters (like Kavach Icarus for example). You'll greatly increase your chances of survival if you get swarmed.

||{{Item List2 |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Faceworm%27s_Nest Faceworm's Nest]
||The Giant Snake Skins can be found in bulk because of the random refine &amp; stat enchants. It can be found for a cheap price in case it's full of random or not really good bonuses, or the price can skyrocket if it's a perfect one stat only GSS (DEX and INT GSSs are the most expensive ones). If you don't have any, you might want to get one of the cheapest for starters. The +10 MDEF is really neat and if you get a pair of Temporal Boots (any of the boots, even the basic ones should work), you'll also get a +15% HP and +5% SP set bonus.

||This one might be a bit complicated to obtain if you're new, but it can be a really good alternative to GSS if you plan on playing Dragon Breath or Ignition Break build and you need a bit of survivability: this garment gives you a +7% resistance to '''ALL''' elements and a 1% chance to regenerate 1% of your damage dealt on one attack (AoE attacks work). You also have a SP bonus per refine so if you get a high enough refine, you can compensate a little for the lack of the HP&amp;SP bonus from the GSS set.

|-
||{{Card |id=4303 Giant Whisper Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1186/giant-whisper Giant Whisper]
||This card should be pretty affordable since MCAs are kind of common now (even though they're still expensive) and people sell most not wanted mini bosses' cards quite cheap. Its effects are : +10 FLEE, +20 ATK if your STR is 80+, MHP+3% if your VIT is 80+, CRIT+3 if your LUK is 80+. There are much better choices out there on garment so you should only keep this for the beginning.
|-
||{{Card |id=4589 Jejeling Card}}

|-
||{{Card |id=4334 Noxious Card}}

|-
||{{Card |id=4133 Raydric Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1163/raydric Raydric]
||Increases your resistance to neutral property attacks by 20%. This one is really good because all monsters hit physically with neutral attacks, so you reduce most of the damage from monsters by 20%. This is really great for grinding solo or doing tough monsters.
|-
||{{Card |id=4588 Wakwak Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/2315/wakwak Wakwak]

I suggest getting them from the market, because killing Beelzebub is difficult. They give a big 20% increase in both HP and SP but beware, don't upgrade them or you'll lose % bonuses per refine made on the shoes.

|-
||{{Item List2 |id=22006 |item=Temporal Boots of Strength |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim]
||The Temporal STR Boots are usually not super expensive, and provide a great ATK bonus; if you refine it at +3 (safe refine) and you have 120 STR, you'll get 57 ATK thanks to these boots. You get +50 ATK by having 120 points in STR, and you get +7 ATK every 3 refines.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=22008 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity |simple=yes}}
||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim]
||The DEX boots are great in case you're spamming skills with Fixed Cast Time. These are the boots you should get in case you play a skill spam build like Dragon Breath or Spiral Pierce, because it gets rid of 0.5 seconds of Fixed Cast Time if you have at least 120 in DEX (which is in most case, enough to eliminate the FCT of your skill's cast).
|-
||{{Card |id=4381 Green Ferus Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1717/ferus Green Ferus]
||The usual easy-to-get card that gives you a nice +10% HP buff (it gets tripled during Berserk so +30% max HP is pretty good).
|-
||{{Card |id=4097 Matyr Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1146/matyr Matyr]
||Same as Green Ferus Card, but it gives +1 AGI instead of +1 VIT. You might want to take this one instead if you need every possible bonus for your ASPD.
|-
||{{Card |id=4107 Verit Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1032/verit Verit]
||Easy to obtain, it's ok for a Dragon Breath build as it increases both your HP and your SP by 8%.
|-
||{{Card |id=31017 Outrageous Cookie Card}}
||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1163/raydric Outrageous Cookie]
||This is one of the few offensive cards on the boots card slot, it's only worth it if you refine your boots a lot (something like +6 to +9), and it might be a bit expensive for beginners.

It suits every build you could play as a RK since it increases your ATK by 3%, your HP by 1000 and your ranged damage by 3% if you leveled up your stats to at least 90. (respectively STR, VIT and DEX). To get it, you only need to do the main quest of Rock Ridge (Fistful of Zeny), which is mostly speaking to NPCs and you only need to be level 100 to do it.

||This accessory eliminates the need of Fly Wings or a Creamy card, and you can enchant it for great effects like Expert Archer or Fatal. While the accessory is easy to get (because you only need to complete the instance once), you need Shards of Gigantes to enchant the earring, which you can get from the instance or on the market (the prices dropped right now, after the enchants on GMT rings came out). You can get more accessories by spending 1 Shard of Gigantes for each accessory, and you can also get a Left Earring if you want to have 2 of them at the same time.

== Builds ==
Please do remember that there's not always a "BEST BUILD", and that all builds are viable. One may pop ahead of the rest and become "THE META" but it will also come accompanied by scarcity and high prices of the corresponding gears. All builds have different strengths and weaknesses, will peak in performance (and also differ in prices) at different steps of the game, from early to endgame.
=== Critical AA ===
----
Remember these wise words from your sensei:
*The best defense is a good offense, and the best offense is a good ol' AA RK  [[File:No1.gif|40px]]

[[File:rkberserk.gif|center]]

[[File:Warning.png]] Even though the Critical AA build that I'll teach you may seem appealing, please do not forget that's it's not easy to exp with it, especially if you follow the stats, which are given for level 175 (You'll get nowhere with 1 point in DEX if you don't have a great critical rate). You should first take a look at the Wind Cutter build as it's easier to do and it'll give you a spike in damage when leveling after switching to Rune Knight.

==== Stats ====
----
Here are the stats I use for my Crit RK:

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 100+
*'''VIT''' 90+
*'''INT''' 40+
*'''DEX''' 1
*'''LUK''' 120

If you're not stuffed good enough yet or want to play solo without foods, AB buffs or a Minstrel, you might want to switch STR and AGI so you can get 190~ ASPD. This build has the goal of making the highest melee damage possible, and it's much better to get as much attack speed as possible before trying to upgrade your damage, since it outshines the little atk boost you get from the 20 last points you could put in STR.

==== Skills ====
----
How to Crit RK 101:
:[[File:Howtorkcrit101.png]]

I'm not even kidding here, these are the only 3rd class skills you need to perform correctly as a Critical Rune Knight. Critical build is all about buffing before simply auto-attacking the enemy, no other skills required.
Of course, there are several 2nd class skills that you mustn't forget !
:[[File:Dontfkinforgetlkspells2.png]]

'''RK November 2019 rework update:''' Ignition Break and Sonic Wave will be able to crit, and Enchant Blade will get buffed, so don't miss out on these skills !

==== Strategy ====
----
The strategy on a Critical build is pretty simple; buff yourself as much as possible before going Berserk and killing everything. The skills and buffs you need to cast before Berserk are better used in this order, because of their duration:

&lt;code>Auto Berserk > Berserk Potion > Enchant Blade > Two-Hand Quicken > Aura Blade > Turisus Runestone > Asir Runestone > Rhydo Runestone > Concentration > Parrying > Magnum Break > Berserk&lt;/code>

This might seem like it's kind of useless but if the fight drags on, you're still under Berserk and your buffs start disappearing (like the runes for example), you will lose a big part of your DPS and end up waiting for Berserk to stop so you can buff again, making you possibly lose a lot of precious time.

If you're simply killing lots of trash mobs, you could also forget Berserk as it could lead to your doom since you could get mobbed and get crushed because your FLEE is halved and you got 0 DEF/MDEF. This is something I try to avoid in Sky Fortress for example, as the Ragged Zombies there hurt quite a lot. Instead, switch to this combo:

&lt;code>Auto Berserk > Berserk Potion > Enchant Blade > Two-Hand Quicken > Aura Blade > Turisus Runestone > Asir Runestone > Rhydo Runestone > Concentration > Parrying&lt;/code>

==== Equipment ====
----
List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for the Critical AA build. Don't forget that you can always take a look again at the General Equipment list, if some items here do not suit you or they are too expensive for you.

If you have no gears yet, going for this set will help you get more easily into midgame. My only issue with it if you're starting out is that it provides basically no critical rate, so you'll have to rely on other sources like your base LUK, buffs or manage to set in your stuff some crit rate equipments/cards.

||The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP !. The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs ! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight.

||This hat gives 10% ASPD bonus, and when you physically attack, you have a chance of transforming into Moonlight Flower: it gives you a %ranged damage bonus, and +100% critical chance. I've seen this hat being used sometimes on Crit RK builds so I thought I would add it here, but this isn't that worth it as there are many ways to achieve +100% critical chance. But it could still be viable since you'd free a lot of other equipment/card slots; you wouldn't need to get any critical bonus anymore, and you could theoretically invest strongly on pure power (like ATK). I consider them training wheels that will allow you to get a 100% critical rate until you get the items required to have it.

||This cute little buddy is your best early friend as it gives you the thief skill Double Attack at level 5. Since a patch from several years ago, you can both proc critical attacks and double attacks on the same hit. This is in my opinion core to the build as you get a big DPS spike thanks to your high ASPD and your already sky-high damage. Do not forget that also the Turisus rune sometimes doubles the damage of one of your hits, and '''it stacks with Double Attack'''. Yes, the quadruple attack spike is not a dream, and it's theoretically possible to use it on the dreadful Crush Strike rune.

The Mech' Arm is &lt;del>a weapon to surpass Metal Gear&lt;/del> a level 4 weapon with quite the correct ATK for a one-handed weapon, has 2 slots and most importantly gives a gigantic +20 Critical Chance bonus. This means you can invest less in LUK and Critical bonus items and cards, and get something else more interesting to further increase your DPS.

||This two-handed sword has a very good weapon ATK and weight, making it quite effective for Spiral Pierce, and it increases % critical damage based on its refine. Its downsides are that big -15% ASPD penalty and the fact that it only has one slot.

||Same as the VM Mace: if you can get the weapon to +15 and get specific enchants like +% Boss damage, +% Critical damage, it can rival the Lindy Hop in terms of damage, but the problem is that you have to get Critical hit by other means unlike the Lindy Hop and its Sharp enchants.

||This new addition to the two-handed swords roster is a pretty good rival to Lindy Hop, and will surpass Vicious Mind in terms of ATK. Unlike this last one who needs a special enchant in order to be unbreakable by itself, this one just needs to be refined to +9 for that. The Broadsword will get enchants later, which might make it worthwhile. Despite its strong bonuses, it has the same problem as the other weapons that the Lindy Hop doesn't suffer from, it's the lack of ASPD, which means you have to compensate in stats or other equipments for that.

||A weapon considered rather pretty meme, the Oriental Sword is an autocast 2HS that casts Sonic Wave. Its inconsistency with the autocast and the fact that it relies on a ranged skill makes it difficult to build around it, but it still brings a strong autocasted skill to the table; my suggestion with this weapon is to just build as usual on your RK and not bother with ranged bonuses except if you can freely add some in your build (aka it doesn't prevent you from taking other important mods). I'd recommend upgrading it to the Patent version as soon as you can, if you desire to go down this route.

This weapon used to be the most endgame two-handed sword we could get, and had the right to stay at the n¬∞1 spot as a weapon for RKs thanks to all the pros it has.

Thanks to the changes to Turisus and Double Attack, this weapon somehow rose above Lindy Hop in both survivability and DPS on Medium enemies; however Rhydo is still a risky bet since it can still break your weapon, and the Lindy Hop still wins on Large monsters.

||The new two-handed sword contender from 17.1 seems able to overpower the Lindy Hop on specific cases, due to its +11 refine bonus which gives +20% damage against Small and Medium sizes. It has a low crit rate bonus but since we have access to Acute and the new Illusion critical enchants, it's not a big problem. It can also be [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Illusion_Equipments_and_Enchants_(17.1) enchanted] pretty good with ATK% and %critical damage. While I heard it can beat higher refine Lindies, I believe that the fact it only has a %size damage increase against Small and Medium but not Large (which are a big part of the MvPs), makes me think it's not that interesting. '''This weapon got a nice boost thanks to its new combo with the Clark Sidecap, allowing it to compensate its weakness on Large monsters by bringing a huge 4% large size modifier every 2 refines of the weapon.'''
Whether it is worth replacing a Snake Hat or an ORC, is something I am currently unable to say; we still lack data on the sword as too few people tried refining it, and I'll need someone to lend me one to be able to test. If you were to use this weapon, I'd recommend after checking out the overall bonuses the weapon and the hat give, to discard size modifier cards on your weapon (WK/CW) and go for something such as critical damage or ATK.

||The new upgrade after the Patent now available, the LT has become more refined and far less of a meme because of its new spec: the weapon now offers some nice POW, P.ATK and ATK% by default, it's indestructible which will allow us to Crush Strike day and night with it, and the SW% mod per refine has been replaced by critical damage per refine, giving us a more uniform boost on our damage since it'll also boost our basic attacks, Storm Blast (and IB if you got something to autocast it). The SW% mod boost can still be found on several refine stages with a good quantity, and also accompanied by Storm Blast% mods. Refine-wise the bonuses end with a stronger crit rate amount compared to previously (10 more), and the old critical damage bonus has been replaced with Melee &amp; Ranged % mods. As this weapon is level 5, we get access to some very cool bonuses as well on grade C and B : more Melee&amp;Ranged% mods and some nice P.ATK and POW.

||New versions of the Thanatos weapons appeared with the Thanos-AD series, and this weapon is the one for RK. It is a very weird combination of WC and AA, more about that in a bit: It gives a good amount of WC% skill mods and ATK per refine, as well as Melee, Size and more WC mods at specific refine stages. The weapon also weirdly has some Wind Cutter autocast feature when doing AAs. The HP/SP leech effect has sadly disappeared (Gravity probably considered it too powerful on endgame because it'd literally heal you full even with a small % amount) and has been replaced with some flat HP/SP regeneration. The grading on this weapon funnily enough is made for us AA users as it boosts Servant Weapon, thus boosting further our damage. It kinda is a janky fun weapon with its own potential; it helps the AoE clearing capacity of the build that would otherwise rely entirely on Storm Blast, and will also fully pierce DEF proving itself pretty neat if you don't have good DEF pierce for the enemies you're fighting and they have very high DEF.

I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK).

||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Old_Glast_Heim Old Glast Heim]
||This used to be, and still is a very good pair of boots for critical builds as it gives a whooping 30% critical damage bonus. The enchants are going to define the price of your boots (if you want to buy them instead of crafting them); what you want at least is to get [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4881/aspd-4 ASPD4] to have an easier time catching the 193 cap. After that, pretty much any special enchant works for a RK (except Muscular Endurance and Speed of Light).
*[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4875/bears-power Bear's Might] will give you the biggest damage increase out of all the enchants (+200 STR) but you have to get hit.
*[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4880/lucky-day Lucky Day] is easier to proc and doesn't have any con; you'll get +200 LUK so you'll have a bit more of ATK, MATK, P.Dodge.
*[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4877/speed-of-light Speed of Light] is an exotic but interesting choice since the arrival of [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_portal MH2], and even more since we got the new [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Fall_Of_Glast_Heim Fall of Glast Heim] instance with the insignia enchants. SoL allows you to dodge half the hits thanks to the P.Dodge proc (Perfect Dodge is halved in MH2), giving you an easier time tanking there, as well as lowering a bit the stress and burden on your healer.
*[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4879/hawkeye Hawkeye] can be quite useful if you're looking for another way to get max ASPD as it gives you +200 DEX so you'll get quite a few ASPD points and a bit of damage. It doesn't have the downside of draining your HPs like [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4877/speed-of-light Speed of Light].
*[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4876/runaway-magic Runaway Magic] gives you +200 INT so you're gonna have a lot of MATK, it will work with Enchant Blade. Don't forget that the bonus ATK from Enchant Blade changes dynamically so you can't cheese the enchant and then switch your boots to something else. To proc Runaway Magic you'll need to cast spells, the most common way to do it is with auto-spells stuffs like CD in Mouth.

||That pair of boots sports special enchants similar to temporal boots but they proc much more often and for a longer time than our old ones. It comboes with other Illusion pieces: you'll get a +5% ATK when paired with the Illusion Armor A-type, and when paired with the Illusion Engine Wing A-type you'll get +10% critical damage. The item by itself doesn't have any %critical damage bonus, but it's not a big loss since we already have a ton of that, and it brings an especially strong enchant that you can slot on it, named [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/25703/modification-module-overpower Overpower]. It gives +50 STR (which synergizes well with our high weapon ATK swords) and +15% ATK, '''when physically attacking''' and for a whooping duration of '''10 seconds'''.

||A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost might come in clutch because of how Storm Blast scales on STR, and also simply because of our usual high STR scaling through Weapon ATK with our big swords.

||This is the Ep18 replacement for Automatic Legs, and works slightly differently: you can now only choose one legendary enchant which will be on the first slot of those boots, so you will want Wolf Orb (Overpower) to get some sweet STR for boosting the Storm Blast autocast and the nice Melee% mod as well. The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%).

The enchants that will be useful for us Crit RKs, are the Attack Speed and the Fatal modules. It is possible to enchant up to 3 times each accessory, so you can put one ASPD and one Fatal enchant on each of them, providing you a lot of ASPD and critical rate (very useful if you play for example the Royal Knight's Broadsword). The third slot is not as important, you may choose what you want to put on it, it's up to your preferences; I personally like using the drain modules which give you HP &amp; SP leech.

*Flash : When equipped with Speed of Light, increases critical damage by 30%.

||This set was during quite a while the main shadow set we had and it still is fairly easy to get in shape as it doesn't require any refinement; it provides 4 very interesting bonuses for us which are:
* ASPD% and flat ASPD temporary buff when casting Enchant Blade based on Shadow Shield refine
* Small chance to autocast Ignition Break while attacking
* +10 All Stats : Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of stat reduction for our VCT !
* +50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters : When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot !
Keep in mind that while the bonus is great, you do not have any space left for other shadow gears. Also, this DEF pierce does not work on boss protocol monsters so beware !

||In case you really need a versatile and stronger DEF Pierce set that works on all kinds of '''Normal''' monsters, you may go for this one instead of the previous one; it will allow you to reach up to 80% DEF Pierce on Normal monsters if you refine all pieces to +10. You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party).

||Compared to the 2 previous sets, a smaller but more effective set exists, based on the 2 Penetration Shadow accessories. But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against '''both Normal and Boss monsters''' ! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

This will help you solve some build planning issues with newer gears that do not provide as much crit rate as before, or because of custom content with very high critical shield.

=== Wind Cutter ===
----
&lt;div style='text-align: center;'>WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH&lt;/div>

[[File:Ryuwc.gif|center]]

If you're starting out as an RK, this is most likely the build you've been suggested. I recommend seeking out the Peuz's set as soon as you're 3rd class and can use the Wind Cutter skill, as the armor set is extremely powerful once you assemble it.

==== Stats ====
----
Here are the stats I use for my WC RK:

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 90+
*'''VIT''' 120
*'''INT''' 50+
*'''DEX''' 90+
*'''LUK''' 1+

When leveling, you should quickly aim to have 90 STR, AGI and DEX:
90 STR is easy to get and will allow you to dish enough damage for a while.
90 AGI will allow you to reach quickly the ASPD cap, especially if your ACD reduction is low (which means the ASPD cap is low too).
90 DEX is a must to be able to hit your enemies, because of their FLEE.
LUK is not a priority because '''WIND CUTTER DOES NOT CRIT GUYS !'''


==== Strategy ====
----
Smash that Wind Cutter button and watch your allies cry in despair over your strong DPS, that's all you gotta do to win ! '''Since the new 2021 job improvement rework, if you want your spin to win to work properly, you need 185 ASPD and 40% ACD to spam like the wind !'''

[[File:Spintowin.png]]

Don't forget that Wind Cutter is a swiss army knife, it changes depending on the weapon you are using, it can have 3 different ways of working :
*With a two-handed sword : 2 hits instead of 1 hit, at a 1250% per hit skill modifier, and the skill will pierce DEF
*With a spear weapon : the damage is considered ranged instead of melee, with a 2000% skill modifier
*With other weapons : nothing specific, with a 1500% skill modifier

Swapping to a spear can prove to be really helpful in situations where you go into an area with lots of monsters with the ability to reflect; this will allow you to bypass it entirely, at the cost of a weaker WC (because you lose the DEF pierce a 2HS provides with the skill). You will be able to escape a lot of deaths, and avoid spending money in Golden X to bypass the reflect.

==== Equipment ====
----
List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for the Wind Cutter build. Don't forget that you can always take a look again at the General Equipment list, if some items here do not suit you or they are too expensive for you. I've also dropped some interesting cards for MH2 since I know a lot of you are reading this guide for its strong capabilities on that content.

||So this set which was pretty underwhelming at first, it ended up being extremely good with the new Wind Cutter rework because of its +100% bonus on the skill. You get an absurd increase in damage with it, and it's super cheap, making the build very cost effective for beginners. You'll lack ACD in the beginning though so the spam will be a bit slow, but it'll quickly get better. You can keep using this set while you improve the remaining gear slots, which will allow you to fill other damage modifiers and also take care of the ACD reduction.

||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Illusion_of_Twins Illusion of Twins]
||The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP ! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats; this cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs ! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight.

||The STR manteau, as many originally cash shop items, is a very powerful option for all non-crit physical builds. That garment bombs you with raw ATK, refined ATK% and spicy %size modifiers ! You'll want to put ACD% enchant on the garment, or ATK% if you somehow already got too much ACD% (but that shouldn't happen until the next RK rework).

||The muffler is the Episode 18 replacement for the Engine Wing B-Type, as it plays the same function of comboing with the physical armor for a 10% ACDr bonus. While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Melee% it brings. The second slot (which is the most interesting one I believe) can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Guide Attack), which can bring up to 24 Perfect Hit rate ! This is extremely important for us on Wind Cutter as our main counter is very high FLEE which some monsters boast thanks to using the skill Agi Up. Perfect Hit will allow us to hit while ignoring FLEE, much like a Critical hit. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one.

||A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting groups of enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost is quite phenomenal; I'd recommend checking with a calculator if this would be stronger for you than Illusion Sprint Shoes as usually multiplcative modifiers tend to do better.

||Compared to the 2 previous sets, a smaller but more effective set exists, based on the 2 Penetration Shadow accessories. But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against '''both Normal and Boss monsters''' ! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

||Alongside the big Ancient Juperos custom episode came lots of new shadow gears, and part of them are combined versions of the previous single racial pierce gauntlets, which allows you to have one piece doing 2 races at the same time. This could be fairly useful for example in the Thanatos Tower instance (and upper floors 11 and 12) where Demon and Angel monsters roam together.

||At the same time as the previous shadow gears, a set of Shadow Armors appeared with the same goal in mind of having 2 races fully DEF pierced, this will allow you more flexibility on your shadow gears choices, or even allow you to have full pierce on 4 races at the same time considering this set does not conflict with the weapon one.

=== Ignition Break ===
----
Looking for a stomping, popular build that crushes everything ? Want to obliterate everything that moves ? Ignition Break can do that, but '''be prepared for a huge budget investment''' to be able to reach the damage of those Rune Knights that impressed you.
[[File:IB-explosion.gif|center]]

====Stats====
----

Here are the stats I'd use for an IB build:

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 30+
*'''VIT''' 90+
*'''INT''' 30+
*'''DEX''' 120
*'''LUK''' 120

We're of course putting 120 STR in this build because it relies heavily in ATK.
Not much AGI needed, since Ignition Break isn't fully spammable. You could get some though if you're planning on getting a high FLEE, but mob trains virtually destroy your FLEE so it's not that worth it. Only start getting some AGI once you get the CD reduction gears for IB.
The 90 VIT is there to help build up your natural HP pool, and also proc the effect of the Heroic Backpack.
This build is all about skill-spamming, so of course we're going to invest a bit of INT to get enough time for the Rideword to regen your HP and SP.
DEX is there at 120 for the cast of Ignition Break; this skill has only variable cast so you can reduce it a lot with stat reduction (Remember, int+dex*2=530 => Instant Cast IB).
LUK should be set at 120 for the critical chance, as well as the damage you get from investing into it with crit gears.

==== Skills ====
----

So the skills you'll probably need as an IB RK, are approx the same as the Critical build except you get Ignition Break, the mounting skills from both LK and RK skill trees (speed is important when doing mob trains).

==== Strategy ====
----

If you want to level your char with the IB build and by doing mob trains, there are several things you need to know:

* Don't face the mobs head on; always keep your distance, use Ignition Break before they get close to you so it hits and staggers them right before they hit you (that's called kiting).

* You need to ALWAYS keep Concentration up (for the Endure effect). It will decide if you'll be able to get away from the monsters after getting attacked, or if the train stomps on you because you get stun-locked by the many monster hits.).

* If you feel like you don't regen enough with the HP/SP leech equipments you got, you can try combining a Succubus/Incubus pet with more leech gears to further increase the chances of replenishing your HP/SP.

* If you die too much with mob trains, try getting a Priest friend or slave to use Kyrie Eleison on you. That way you can survive longer and train your kiting strategy.

==== Equipment ====
----

List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for the Ignition Break build.

If you have no gears yet, going for this set will help you get more easily into midgame. My only issue with it if you're starting out is that it provides basically no critical rate, so you'll have to rely on other sources like your base LUK, buffs or manage to set in your stuff some crit rate equipments/cards.

||This weapon is a bit peculiar and will force you to keep on farming because it consumes 15 SP every 10 seconds. What is neat about it, is that it ALWAYS steals 1% of the damage you do to convert it into HP, which will regen a lot of HP since IB hurts so much; what's more it's naturally Fire enchanted ! Quite the good cheap weapon for farming anything which isn't Shadow/Fire/Water.

||Pretty much the same as the other Crimson weapons, but this one is two-handed and has more weight; it's rather more offensive-oriented since you can't use a shield and it has more ATK. If you get a mount with a spear or a lance, you won't have any size penalty problem as you would normally, which makes it the strongest of the Crimson weapons for RK in terms of damage, but you lose the possibility of having Parrying with a two-handed sword or simply a shield with a spear; up to you !

Watch out for the Hell Power that you can sometimes cast on yourself, it'll prevent you from being resurrected for several minutes. It's quite useful for beginners on the IB build as it gives you 20 Perfect Dodge: perfect to avoid some attacks of the mob train and prevent getting staggered, which often means your death.

||A 200 ATK two-handed sword with a rare capacity of 3 slots and gives you a small ATK bonus (+20) if you have 96 STR or more. This could prove to be a good alternative to other 2HS because of the versatility of the 3 slots; you could put a Hunter Fly card or more for life stealing and still mix it with ~10-20% damage cards (like Hydra, Skeleton Worker, White Knight).

If you have a Rideword Hat and a Hunter Fly Card in your weapon you'll regenerate lots of HP quite often and never run out of SP too. Since the new Ghost Palace update, you can also enchant your Thanatos weapon, you can get nice effects like an elemental enchantment (they're a bit similar to Vicious Mind enchantments).

||Prior to the arrival of the Claw Sword, it was the wet dream of each Rune Knight. This weapon used to be the most endgame two-handed sword we could get, and had the right to stay at the n¬∞1 spot as a weapon for RKs thanks to all the pros it has. It has the most ATK out of all 2HS, has 2 slots, gives ATK% and ASPD% bonuses based on the refine, is indestructible (goodbye Golem Card), and is enchantable twice ([https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Malangdo_Enchant Malangdo Enchant]. Getting a Lindy past +10 used to be every main Crit RK's goal (You can settle for a +8 if you find it too hard or too expensive to go further in the refine hell). You should aim for Sharp enchants.

||One of the two cards that came out with 17.2 for two-handed sword RKs, this card blesses us with the mighty Melee modifier, and gives us the indestructible property to our weapon. Considering we now got a very strong melee boost with the new Thanatos Tower cards, I wouldn't recommend it alongside the thanatos combo, except if you do Crush Strikes in which case your weapon could break and this card would prevent it.

||The other card that came out with 17.2 for two-handed sword RKs, it boosts heavily critical damage based on the refine of the weapon. Due to the large quantity of critical damage everywhere else on the slots and the other better options available (size, melee), it is highly recommended to forget this card and go for the other choices listed before (it is still listed as a possibility per nature of my guide, built to show the many paths available to you as the reader).

||A card that appeared with the last update on Bioresearch Laboratory; this card is a stronger version of the Greater Special Alnoldi, and it works on a bigger variety of weapons (all swords and daggers).

||{{Item List2 |id=2189 |item=Mad Bunny |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

||This shield is pretty neat as it's more focused on offensive than usual shields, because it gives 5% ATK and MATK; you'll get more bonuses if you manage to refine it to +7 and later but it's quite hard and expensive. In PvM there are 2 other effects otherwise not available, which are a 10% reflect damage and a 10% chance to be able to reflect magic attacks for a few seconds.

||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/3621/pet-child Cutie]
||A new shield that appeared with Episode 16.2; this shield is really awesome because it's kind of a jack of all trades. You get ASPD depending on the refine (5% at +0, can go as far as 10% at +9), and a Neutral reduction which works the same way as the ASPD bonus. I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK). This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=28942 |item=Cursed Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}

||The CK's shield is now most of the time the BiS, for all builds. It gives a nice 10% ASPD bonus, increases a bit less than Mad Bunny at +0 your ATK and MATK (3% instead of 5%) and you get 7% damage reduction from all properties. If you end up getting a +9, you'll get 1 flat ASPD. A +0 should be more than enough though !
|-

||This shield is quite rare because nobody bothers trying to get one. It gives you the ability to use Shield Spell Lv 1, which can be used to increase your ATK based on the shield base defense. With this shield it's not extremely good, but why would you refuse a possibly free ATK bonus ? You can always switch after using the ATK buff for another shield (but don't bother with this shield if you aren't looking for any kind of min-maxing, the ATK bonus is not really incredible).

||The Giant Snake Skins can be found in bulk because of the random refine &amp; stat enchants. It can be found for a cheap price in case it's full of random or not really good bonuses, or the price can skyrocket if it's a perfect one stat only GSS (DEX and INT GSSs are the most expensive ones). If you don't have any, you might want to get one of the cheapest for starters. The +10 MDEF is really neat and if you get a pair of Temporal Boots (any of the boots, even the basic ones should work), you'll also get a +15% HP and +5% SP set bonus. Try getting a GSS with several STR enchants for our IB build. If you're trying to push your critical rate but with a low budget, you can try getting a Green Maiden Card since it'll give you a lot of critical rate as your GSS will most likely be +10 or more, because they are dropped already refined up to +12 in the Faceworm's Nest instance.

||This one might be a bit complicated to obtain if you're new, but it can be a really good alternative to GSS if you plan on playing Dragon Breath or Ignition Break build and you need a bit of survivability: this garment gives you a +7% resistance to '''ALL''' elements and a 1% chance to regenerate 1% of your damage dealt on one attack (AoE attacks like IB work).

It can be as good as a +9 FAW with 3 Fatal3 enchants, but only if you equip a pair of Illusion Leg A to get the +10% Critical damage bonus from the combo, which allows it to reach the same critical damage potential as the FAW.

||This is our go-to, not too expensive garment for raw damage, a bit similar to HBP as it gives you a bonus different for each stat you've increased, every 20 base points. The reason why it surpasses HBP, is because you can enchant it 3 times (as long as you got it refine to +9, otherwise it's 2 times at +7 and only once under) with strong enchants like Fatal, and it can go up to Fatal 4 on one enchant.

While it may not surpass the Agi Manteau in damage, it wins in utility. The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be an important source of damage with the Melee% it brings. The second slot we will want the Wolf Orb (Critical) which can provide up to +15 Critical rate and +24% Critical damage. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Dex) on this one if you're playing with stats for cast reduction, or go for Wolf Orb (Str) if you don't need it or play VCT% reduction.

||Part of the new Thanatos Tower update, this card is sickeningly powerful as it gives at 120 STR a whooping 55% Melee damage increase ! Definitely an asset, but be careful because you need a Mistress of Shelter card equipped in your armor to benefit of the biggest part of the card.

||This set was during quite a while the main shadow set we had and it still is fairly easy to get in shape as it doesn't require any refinement; it provides 2 very interesting bonuses for us which are:
* +10 All Stats : Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of stat reduction for our VCT !
* 50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters : When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot !
Keep in mind that while the bonus is great, you do not have any space left for other shadow gears. Also, this DEF pierce does not work on boss protocol monsters so beware !

||In case you really need a versatile and stronger DEF Pierce set that works on all kinds of '''Normal''' monsters, you may go for this one instead of the previous one; it will allow you to reach up to 80% DEF Pierce on Normal monsters if you refine all pieces to +10. You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party). The biggest issue with this set is the amount of shadow gears that require refinement, which sometimes require expensive components.

||Compared to the 2 previous sets, a smaller but more effective set exists, based on the 2 Penetration Shadow accessories. But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against '''both Normal and Boss monsters''' ! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

||Alongside the big Ancient Juperos custom episode came lots of new shadow gears, and part of them are combined versions of the previous single racial pierce gauntlets, which allows you to have one piece doing 2 races at the same time.

This will help you solve some build planning issues with newer gears that do not provide as much crit rate as before, or because of custom content with very high critical shield.

||The One Ring as some might say, this shadow gear actually is so strong it can occupy the spot of BiS shadow ring as it provides CD reduction for Ignition Break. When refined and combined with Volar and a double Wave Break Automatic Armor, one will be able to spam IB without any kind of delay, thus making this skill exponentially strong, even way more than what it already was.

||The full set that includes the Ignition Shadow Ring seen above, is pretty good and versatile but might not be the very best for those that seek perfection. It gives a bit more of IB skill mod which an RK usually already has plenty of, and will provide DEF pierce on all races by at least 40% depending on the refines of your set. The issue with this is that it's not a full DEF pierce, and also you lose the slots for the Almighty accessories.

=== Spiral Pierce ===
----
[[File:rkspiralpierce.png|center|400px]]
Some of you have been asking for it, and here it is ! An unpopular yet efficient single-target ranged skill, that can actually go high in terms of DPS. Stay true to your Lord Knight roots and make Seyren proud !

====Stats====
----

Here are the stats for Spiral Pierce :

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 120~
*'''VIT''' 90~
*'''INT''' 90~
*'''DEX''' 120
*'''LUK''' 1

We're of course putting 120 STR in this build because it relies heavily in ATK.
Close to 120 base AGI is necessary because we're looking for maximum spammability on this build.
The 90 VIT is there to help build up your natural HP pool, eliminate the stun possibility and also proc the effect of the Heroic Backpack.
Since this is all about skill-spamming, so of course we're going to invest a lot of INT to get enough time for the Rideword to regen your HP and SP, as well as helping reduce VCT.
We got 120 DEX to reduce the most possible the cast as well as eliminate FCT thanks to Temporal Dex Boots.
LUK should get the remaining points for a small ATK bonus.


==== Skills ====
----

So this could be simply played like other skill-focused builds where you only focus on a single skill (which here is Spiral Pierce of course), but you may also level other 3rd class ranged skills like {{Skill List |id=2002 |skill=Sonic Wave |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2004 |skill=Hundred Spear |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath |simple=yes}}.
Another good addition would be {{Skill List |id=57 |skill=Brandish Spear |simple=yes}} since it's ranged since the skill rework, and scales off STR.

==== Strategy ====
----

It is mostly going to revolve around spamming Spiral Pierce, so I'd recommend setting your Spiral Pierce hotkey on Smartcast mode in NovaExt.
If you don't know how to do that, you might want to read the tutorial [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/NovaExt here].
If you feel like you don't regen enough with the HP/SP leech equipments you got, you can try getting a Succubus/Incubus pet to further increase the chances of resplenishing your HP/SP.

Spiral Pierce is a skill that requires 86% ACD for maximum spam.

==== Equipment ====
----

||The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP ! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats; this cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs ! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight. Feel free as well to swap the Powerful Nives on armor and shoes for Dexterous Nives if you have some issues with Cast Time.

||It's the same as the Pitman one but without the HIT part, except it has a combo with the Raydric Card which will make you much tankier : +10% Neutral Resistance (Raydric already gives +20%) and +5% more ATK. The ATK part of the combo is pretty neat because it compensates for the loss of a damage card on the garment slot like Brown Rat Card or Wakwak Card.

You get ASPD depending on the refine (5% at +0, can go as far as 10% at +9), and a Neutral reduction which works the same way as the ASPD bonus. I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK). This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players.

While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Melee% it brings. The second slot (which is the most interesting one I believe) can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Guide Attack), which can bring up to 24 Perfect Hit rate ! This is extremely important for us on Spiral Pierce as our main counter is very high FLEE which some monsters boast thanks to using the skill Agi Up. Perfect Hit will allow us to hit while ignoring FLEE, much like a Critical hit. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one or (Dex) if you need to reduce your cast time.

||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Illusion_of_Twins Illusion of Twins]
||A very strong contender that appeared within the Illusion dungeons, these shoes provide us by themselves a +15% increase on all sizes at +11, and then as all illusion gears we can enchant them and go for double Powerful Nives (Try to get Lv 2); through this we will also obtain +14 STR and +14% damage to all Races, which is the other reason they are so strong. You may also go for DEX nives if you need the stats for cast reduction, with lower damage boost. Beware also that those boots have no FCT reduction, you '''will''' have to find how to take care of Spiral's FCT somewhere else (for example go for the Illusion Sprint Mail for the combo !).

||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/news/airship-crash-patch-notes-189-r393/ Airship Crash]
||A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting groups of enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost is quite phenomenal; I'd recommend checking with a calculator if this would be stronger for you than Illusion Sprint Shoes as usually multiplcative modifiers tend to do better. Same as above, these boots do not have integrated FCT reductions so you will need something else to take care of it, like the Casting Onyx costume enchant for example.

||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/news/airship-crash-patch-notes-189-r393/ Airship Crash]
||Another pair of stats boots just like above, this one is an interesting alternative for us because of the huge quantity of DEX it brings, and there's a bit of strategy tied to it: You can exploit this to completely disregard the need of stacking DEX in your gears, only relying on your base 120 DEX (which with this setup, is not even needed to be kept that high except for HIT reasons) because getting that 175 bonus DEX will allow you to clear completely your VCT through stats. Yes you'll have a dirty cast time when the boots do not proc and that will make it awful to proc, but what if I told you there's an alternate way to deal with that ? If you possess a Vernan, you can simply spam Sonic Wave pretty fast since the skill has no cast time and you have the reduced CD and more than enough ACD% reduction; you will thus manage to easily proc the big DEX boost, and can safely switch back to Spiral Pierce. Neat huh ?

||This is the Ep18 replacement for Automatic Legs, and works slightly differently: you can now only choose one legendary enchant which will be on the first slot of those boots, so you will want Wolf Orb (Firing Shot) to get some DEX to clear cast time and for more HIT, as well as some Ranged%. The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%). You could also get the Wolf Orb (Fixed Casting) but we have a lot of other ways to get that nowadays so I wouldn't recommend it. The last slot is negligible, being HP/SP/Heal power... Just try to aim for HP through the Wolf Orbs (Vital) and (Robust) if possible or if your survivability needs a boost.

And the one which interests us the most is Expert Archer. Depending on the level you obtain it at, you can fetch up to +10% Ranged damage and +20 HIT, so pretty much with 2 accessories with 2 perfect enchants each, that means +40% Ranged and +80 HIT !

||This set was during quite a while the main shadow set we had and it still is fairly easy to get in shape as it doesn't require any refinement; it provides 4 very interesting bonuses for us which are:
* ASPD% and flat ASPD temporary buff when casting Enchant Blade based on Shadow Shield refine
* +10 All Stats : Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of status reduction for our VCT !
* +50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters : When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot !

||In case you really need a versatile and stronger DEF Pierce set that works on all kinds of '''Normal''' monsters, you may go for this one instead of the previous one; it will allow you to reach up to 80% DEF Pierce on Normal monsters if you refine all pieces to +10. You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party).

But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against '''both Normal and Boss monsters''' ! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

=== Sonic Wave ===
----
[[File:weiss_sonicwave.gif|center]]

You've been looking for a ranged build because you've tasted too much melee reflect ? You still wanted to use a critical build because stacking HIT with Spiral Pierce ain't your cup of tea ?
Look no further, Sonic Wave is here to fill that void in your heart !

====Stats====
----
Here's an average stat setup for SW that you can use:

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 90+
*'''VIT''' 90+
*'''INT''' 40+
*'''DEX''' 1
*'''LUK''' 120

Yes you may think it is very similar to the Critical AA build if you've played it, which means it is totally compatible as a build swap !


==== Skills ====
----
Skill-wise, we find yet again the usual buffs any physical RK will want:
[[File:Howtorkcrit101.png]] [[File:Rkskillbuffsnotaa.png]]

The reason why we want Enchant Blade here even if it doesn't bring any damage bonus to skills, is if you wanna one day use the '''Rune Knight Shadow Shield''' for the attack speed bonus it provides temporarily when casting Enchant Blade.

==== Strategy ====
----
Here we get the same usual buff routine for physical RKs like the other builds:

&lt;code>Auto Berserk > Berserk Potion > Enchant Blade > Two-Hand Quicken > Aura Blade > Turisus Runestone > Asir Runestone > Concentration > Parrying > Magnum Break&lt;/code>

RK is a class that becomes a powerhouse all thanks to its buffs, so never forget them !

Sonic Wave is a skill which requires 50% ACD for maximum spam '''when using a Vernan to remove most of the cooldown''', otherwise it's not necessary to get ACD.

==== Equipment ====
----
List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for the SW build. Don't forget that you can always take a look again at the General Equipment list, if some items here do not suit you or they are too expensive for you.

||[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1215/stem-worm Stem Worm] or [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1993/naga Naga]
||One of the famous crimson weapons. The base ATK is low but it'll get much stronger thanks to the special ATK bonus that increases each time you refine it, up to +15. The reason why you would want to go for this weapon is either because you have one with a good elemental advantage (Fire and Holy are great) and refined +7 or more, either it's simply refined past +10 and you wish to make use of it (even if it has a useless element like Poison) because you want to play more defensively with a racial/elemental carded shield that will keep you alive. The fact that it's a spear also synergizes well if you're using a mount for the 100% size on all sizes.

||Abyss Glast Heim
||This new addition to the two-handed swords roster is a pretty good rival to Lindy Hop, and will surpass Vicious Mind in terms of ATK. Unlike this last one who needs a special enchant in order to be unbreakable by itself, this one just needs to be refined to +9 for that. The Broadsword will get enchants later, which might make it worthwhile. Despite its strong bonuses, it has the same problem as the other weapons that the Lindy Hop doesn't suffer from, it's the lack of ASPD, which means you have to compensate in stats or other equipments for that.

Getting a Lindy past +10 used to be every main Crit RK's goal (You can settle for a +8 if you find it too hard or too expensive to go further in the refine hell).

||This shield is pretty neat as it's more focused on offensive than usual shields, because it gives 5% ATK and MATK; you'll get more bonuses if you manage to refine it to +7 and later but it's quite hard and expensive.

You get ASPD depending on the refine (5% at +0, can go as far as 10% at +9), and a Neutral reduction which works the same way as the ASPD bonus. I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK).  This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players because of it's 10% DEF pierce bonus.

||The Giant Snake Skins can be found in bulk because of the random refine &amp; stat enchants. It can be found for a cheap price in case it's full of random or not really good bonuses, or the price can skyrocket if it's a perfect one stat only GSS (DEX and INT GSSs are the most expensive ones).

It used to be one of the best for DPS characters as it gives a nice increase in damage on the offensive stats (STR, DEX, LUK) as long as you have 90 in the stat associated with the bonus you want, and as long as the bag is refined to +7 or +9.

These enchants' strength depends on the refine of your garment so if you go for this one, you'll need to refine it to at least +7, and +9 if possible. It can be as good as a +9 FAW with 3 Fatal3 enchants, but only if you equip a pair of Illusion Leg A to get the +10% Critical damage bonus from the combo, which allows it to reach the same critical damage potential as the FAW.

While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be one good source of damage with the Ranged% it brings. The second slot can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Critical), which can bring up to +15 Critical Rate and +24% Critical Damage. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one.

||A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, it is simply interesting because of our usual high STR scaling through Weapon ATK with our big weapons.

||This set was during quite a while the main shadow set we had and it still is fairly easy to get in shape as it doesn't require any refinement; it provides 4 very interesting bonuses for us which are:
* A bunch of SW% skill mod based on the shadow weapon refine
* ASPD% and flat ASPD temporary buff when casting Enchant Blade based on Shadow Shield refine
* +10 All Stats : Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of status reduction for our VCT !
* +50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters : When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot !

||One of the important stats and not always easy to fetch, is the After Cast Delay reduction. This set allows us to get 15% more reduction of it, without changing any of our gears, which is a big asset because it allows us to focus more on damage in equipments.

||In case you really need a versatile and stronger DEF Pierce set that works on all kinds of '''Normal''' monsters, you may go for this one instead of the previous one; it will allow you to reach up to 80% DEF Pierce on Normal monsters if you refine all pieces to +10. You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party). The biggest issue with this set is the amount of shadow gears that require refinement, which sometimes require expensive components.

||Compared to the 2 previous sets, a smaller but more effective set exists, based on the 2 Penetration Shadow accessories. But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against '''both Normal and Boss monsters''' ! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

=== Dragon Breath ===
----
[[File:cutedragonknight.gif|center]]

You feel like RK is not naturally bulky enough ? You want to leave all the job to your dragon while you chill hard ? You wanna take a shower of monsters and still not give a damn ? Then this might be for you !

====Stats====
----
Here's an average stat setup for DB that you can use:

*'''STR''' 30+
*'''AGI''' 30+
*'''VIT''' 120
*'''INT''' 120
*'''DEX''' 120
*'''LUK''' 1+

It is interesting to get just a bit of STR to increase your maximum weight for carrying pots and farming.
You will want a little bit of AGI for faster animation when getting fairly well geared, this is not a priority at all though.
VIT and INT are necessary for the damage of Dragon Breath since it is based on HP and SP.
DEX is there of course to reduce heavily the cast time.
LUK won't bring much benefit to us, so leave it alone except if you wanna push it to 90ish and get close to Curse immunity, but you probably won't have enough points for that.

==== Skills ====
----
These are the skills we want to pick as DB RK:
[[File:dbknightskills.png]] [[File:dbrkskills.png]]

==== Strategy ====
----
Dragon Breath by default only has access to Fire and Water elements, but thanks to the update on the runes, you can now get several different elements through them. Dragon Breath (Fire) can become Holy through Turisus, and Shadow with Lux Anima. Dragon Breath Water can become Ghost with Asir, and Neutral with Lux Anima. Please remember that Lux Anima will overwrite both Turisus and Asir, so this is kind of a weakness this rune has for us DB users as sometimes we will be forced to not use it in order to hit some elemental monsters.

One easy path when starting on this build is to heavily stack sources of HP and SP leech, in order to proc them on packs of monsters with the AoE of Dragon Breath; this will allow you to survive even longer on top of your already sky high health pool.

Dragon Breath is a skill with a long ACD of 3 seconds for which we need a reduction of 96% for maximum spam; this is however hindered by the fact that DB has a hard animation delay, which prevents you from spamming faster even with the reduction amount reached. The only counter measure to this is to perform "dancing" (aka animation cancel by moving) or to get swarmed by monsters to get your animation cancelled by their hits.

One more thing to remember: thanks to Dragonic Aura as a Dragon Knight, the 3rd class skill Dragon Breath gets a big boost from POW and P.ATK, so Level 5 weapons have a stronger impact than you might think if you refine them high because of the P.ATK added every refine.

==== Equipment ====
----
List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for the DB build. Don't forget that you can always take a look again at the General Equipment list, if some items here do not suit you or they are too expensive for you.

||A fairly new set that is available through a custom beginner content, this practically free set will boost you in many ways : %HP, ACD, Dragon Breath skill mod and also 0.5s FCT reduction. If you have no gears yet, going for this set will help you get more easily into midgame.

||This set was some time ago a staple in both tanking and DB builds, it still works wonderfully today. This will give you everything you want on such a build: ACD, FCT reduction and HP. All these bonuses appear when the set is heavily refined, and you'll absolutely want to enchant each piece of the set with Stamina/Dexterous Nives (Lv2 if possible) to get a huge HP/ranged bonus at +11; it is possible to get two on each piece.

||The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots (So possibly 2 Stamina Nives Lv2, +14 VIT and +14% MHP or Dexterous Nives if you need some Ranged% and DEX for the cast time), and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP ! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Stamina Nives but they can be enchanted with some DEX to help us with cast time reduction. This cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on.

||This two-handed sword is really nice for survival because it gives you a chance to regenerate a small part of the damage you do on a attack, including AoE attacks.

For Dragon Breath this is actually incredible as we have a nice AOE that can be spammed fairly well, and with high enough damage and enough monsters you can basically keep your health full at all times. The disadvantages of this weapon are that it drains SP continuously and has not slot to equip cards (thus can't do the 17.2 DB card set); however this is slightly compensated by the fact it can be [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Malangdo_Enchant enchanted] twice with ranged mods.

Since this is a level 5 weapon it has grades, and very interesting ones at grades C and B: %ranged damage is always welcome, the new RES &amp; MRES stats will help you stay alive against future difficult contents, and the bonus size reduction will be a nice addition to DK's bulkiness.

||The muffler is the Episode 18 replacement for the Engine Wing B-Type, as it plays the same function of comboing with the physical armor for a 10% ACDr bonus. The enchant slots are different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Ranged% it brings. The second slot can be enchanted with the Wolf Orb (Speed) which will help out with our usually abysmal ASPD. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, you might want to go for Wolf Orb (Vit) or (Dex) on this one.

||[https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/news/airship-crash-patch-notes-189-r393/ Airship Crash]
||A new pair of boots which gives HP and SP per refine rate, its main advantage is that it allows you to gain +175 VIT kinda similarly to Muscular Endurance with Temporal Boots, except this time it's when you are dealing damage. This means that you can keep this up and bulk up your damage without the need to get hit, thus potentially keep it up all day if you're quick enough when grinding. It also gives you a bit of ACD% reduction which is neat. The big issue with those boots as you may have noticed, is that it does not provide any FCT reduction. You will have to find the 0.5s elsewhere, there are a few options that can take care of that (The easiest and smallest one being the Casting Onyx costume enchant).

||This is the Ep18 replacement for Automatic Legs, and works slightly differently: you can now only choose one legendary enchant which will be on the first slot of those boots, so you will want Wolf Orb (Firing Shot) to help with cast time and get some Ranged% as well. The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants, so we will go for the FCT one since Wolf Orb (Physical Force) only provides Size%, except if you plan on focusing on Dragonic Breath later down the road. The last slot is actually pretty important for us for once, we want to go for Wolf Orb (Robust) as it provides both great amounts of HP&amp;SP, and it will in most builds boost the damage more than Vital or Mental.

=== Hundred Spear ===
----

The most thematic spear build of Rune Knight, this lightning fast AOE ranged attack is a great tool for farming packs of monsters.
Currently WIP !

====Stats====
----

Here are the stats for Hundred Spear :

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 90~
*'''VIT''' 90+
*'''INT''' 50+
*'''DEX''' 120
*'''LUK''' 90~

We're of course putting 120 STR in this build because it relies heavily on ATK.
Only around 90 AGI because of the big cooldown this skill has, even with the gear reductions.
The 90 VIT is there to help build up your natural HP pool, help eliminate the stun possibility.
We mostly increase INT to have a bigger SP pool, considering the casting time of HS is extremely low by default. 
We got 120 DEX to reduce further the cast time and most importantly build up our HIT rate.
LUK will also help us get more HIT rate.


==== Skills ====
----

Since this is a spear-only build, it is highly recommended that you take Dragon Training and get a mount so that you do not suffer from size penalty. Do not forget also to level up Spiral Pierce as its level is part of the formula of Hundred Spear. You'll want also to level up Charging Pierce for the occasional boosted damage every 11th attack, and Dragonic Breath since it allows you to build up AP, eventually to be able to cast Dragonic Aura which boosts temporarily Hundred Spear.

==== Strategy ====
----

Hundred Spear is a skill with 0.5s ACD, but it is not necessary to reduce it because at the time of writing this, there is no gear combination that allows players to drop the CD of Hundred Spear from 3s to below 0.5s. However if you feel like maximizing your damage output then maybe you can mix up some another skill (Spiral Pierce ? Dragonic Breath ?) during the cooldown of HS, and get some ACD % reduction.

==== Equipment ====
----

List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for the Hundred Spear build.

||The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP ! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats; this cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs ! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight. Feel free as well to swap the Powerful Nives on armor and shoes for Dexterous Nives if you have some issues with Cast Time.

||That new garment from the 17.1 episode Illusion can be enchanted thrice and you'll want to get 2 [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/25690/modification-module-fast Fast] modules. These enchants' strength depends on the refine of your garment so if you go for this one, you'll need to refine it to at least +7, and +9 if possible. Since it's the B-type, when combined with the A-type armor we'll get 10% ACD so it's pretty strong for us, especially if you don't use a weapon that gives ACD like the TGL.

||The 2.0 version of the old Illusion Engine Wing, it is the same as the old one but with slightly higher stats. We still have access to interesting modules like {{Item List2 |id=1000127 |item=Automatic Module (Fast) |simple=yes}} but the new addition that may make you think twice about getting this garment or another is the new {{Item List2 |id=1000143 |item=Automatic Module (Powerful) |simple=yes}} that brings a very welcome %Ranged boost.

||The STR manteau, as many originally cash shop items, is a very powerful option for all non-crit physical builds. That garment bombs you with raw ATK, refined ATK% and spicy %size modifiers ! You'll want to put ACD% enchant on the garment, or Ranged% if you somehow already got too much ACD%.

||The muffler is the Episode 18 replacement for the Engine Wing B-Type, as it plays the same function of comboing with the physical armor for a 10% ACDr bonus. While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Melee% it brings. The second slot (which is the most interesting one I believe) can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Guide Attack), which can bring up to 24 Perfect Hit rate ! This is extremely important for us as our main counter is very high FLEE which some monsters boast thanks to using the skill Agi Up. Perfect Hit will allow us to hit while ignoring FLEE, much like a Critical hit. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one or (Dex) if you need to reduce your cast time.

||That new pair of boots sports special enchants similar to temporal boots but they proc much more often and for a longer time than our old ones.

**[https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/25702/modification-module-firing-shot Firing Shot] which gives +50 DEX and +10% Ranged damage.

||A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting groups of enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost is quite phenomenal; I'd recommend checking with a calculator if this would be stronger for you than Illusion Sprint Shoes as usually multiplcative modifiers tend to do better.

The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%). The last slot is negligible, being HP/SP/Heal power... Just try to aim for HP through the Wolf Orbs (Vital) and (Robust) if possible or if your survivability needs a boost.

||Part of the early batch we got with MH2, this set will fill the remaining slots when using an armor/shield/shoes set, just like the Reload set. It'll provide us with a bunch of extra ATK and ATK%, so this is a nice addition if we don't need DEF pierce.

||In case you really need a versatile and stronger DEF Pierce set that works on all kinds of '''Normal''' monsters, you may go for this one instead of the previous one; it will allow you to reach up to 80% DEF Pierce on Normal monsters if you refine all pieces to +10. You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party). The biggest issue with this set is the amount of shadow gears that require refinement, which sometimes require expensive components.

||Compared to the 2 previous sets, a smaller but more effective set exists, based on the 2 Penetration Shadow accessories. But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against '''both Normal and Boss monsters''' ! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

||At the same time as the previous shadow gears, a set of Shadow Armors appeared with the same goal in mind of having 2 races fully DEF pierced, this will allow you more flexibility on your shadow gears choices, or even allow you to have full pierce on 4 races at the same time considering this set does not conflict with the weapon one.

== Leveling ==
This is the usual routine I go through when making a new character. I think trying out the instances, if you have the possibility to do so with friends or a guild, is a better way to enjoy the game than simply grinding mindlessly the Gramps maps. '''Do not switch directly to 3rd class.''' Please do not forget that going down the rebirth path is '''required''' for the Critical build and simply too good to be avoided anyway, [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_job_change_into_a_3rd_Class_without_transcending.2Frebirth.3F here's why].

The easiest way to level up as a Swordsman/Knight, is to go down the AGI path. Make sure you level first your STR and your DEX to 50, then increase your AGI to 90. When you're finished with AGI, get your DEX to 70 and max your STR and AGI.
* '''Lv 1+'''
** First thing to do if you haven't done the tutorial: Go kill some Porings in Hidden Dungeon to get Job Lv 10 and switch to Swordsman, then start grinding at Payon Cave. It is advised that you use your Novice Potions here if you got any, because your HP pool is very low at the beginning; Red Potions will do in case you didn't do the tutorial. Since the Renewal update the Zombies are much weaker so kill them first to get a few levels. Once you get around level 10-15, start killing the Skeletons and the other monsters.
* '''Lv 26+'''
** When you think you're doing fine at Lv 1 of the dungeon and the pace is getting slower, go straight to Lv 2. The skeletons are now much weaker compared to their old self years ago in Pre-Renewal.
* '''Lv 45+'''
** At this level I usually go to Orc Dungeon and kill groups of Orc Zombies with AoE skills. '''''If you want to grind faster, you may use [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12114/elemental-converter-fire Fire Elemental Converters] since the monsters here are weak against Fire. It'll be also useful later at Glast Heim, where you'll be hunting Evil Druids and Wraiths.'''''  If you're between level 50 and 59, you can try the Eden quests for the Orcs if you want to get a free leveling bonus in Orc Dungeon: Go to Eden, talk to Secretary Lime Evenor to register, then you can ask Instructor Boya to test you, you should get the Orc Dungeon quest. Don't forget talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Orc Dungeon before you start hunting Orc Zombies and Orc Skeletons. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to Instructor Boya. Since you passed the test, you'll have access to some special equipments for beginners, available by talking to Administrator Michael in the equipment storage room. If there' something you don't understand, you should check out the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group Eden Group wiki page].
* '''Lv 70-79'''
** Here we'll keep doing the Eden quests since they give out nice EXP, and you get access to better items: [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_70-79 Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest] at Glast Heim. I recommend here that you also get the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_71_-_85 Hunting Board Quests] for both Evil Druid and Wraith. This way you kill 2 birds with one stone, or rather you earn twice EXP with one hunt.
:: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Glast Heim Churchyard before you start hunting Wraiths and Evil Druids. Watch out for Mimics there since they're quite nasty and will easily kill you if you aren't prepared. Most players do this quest too while leveling, so do not hesitate to ask other players if they want to team up, it'll make your hunting quest faster and safer. Also do not forget that you have to kill 20 Wraiths first, talk to Johan, then you can kill the Evil Druids. You may then talk to Johan again, then go see Instructor Ur and Administrator Michael to get your rewards.
* '''Lv 85+'''
** Level 85 is the minimum level required to join the first bracket of the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Leveling_Guide#Gramps Gramps quests]. Gramps quests are usually rotated at the start of every month, so try to end your quest before that. It is highly recommended that you do the Gramps quests whenever you can if you want to level as fast as possible. Once per day is already good enough but if you want to tryhard even further, the cooldown resets after 4 hours once you've turned in the quest (you can still go back in Gramps' map and grind without the quest). You can stay here until level 115 (the other Gramps map) if you want.
* '''Lv 99'''
** This is where it gets really important: if you want to "skip" the transcendent 2nd leveling phase, you can do a simple trick that consists of doing high-level quests when you're at level 99, and get the experience rewards only after rebirthing to level 1. This is what I usually do :
***Get level 99 at Gramps 85+, but I do not turn in the two 400-monsters hunting quests.
***Do [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] and stop before the king's reward (Watch on the link where you get the EXP and stop doing the quest before getting it, where you stop isn't really important).
***Rebirth, then kill some Porings to switch to High Swordsman.
***Turn in [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village], you should get around Base Level 70 and Job Level 50, you can then change to Lord Knight.
***After becoming Lord Knight, go turn in the Gramps quests at Eden, you should be somewhere close to 98/69. You can then finish your levels at Gramps 85+, or go to Rock Ridge and go east to kill the cowboy buffalos; the Shotgun Buffalo gives like triple the job exp of the other monsters, so focusing them will make your last levels faster. You're finally 99/70 ? Congratz ! You can go to the Main Office and become a Rune Knight. ''Do not worry about your level progression bar not reappearing, it's just a visual bug; you can disconnect and reconnect to make it appear again.''

Once you become a Rune Knight, your primary goal should be to '''get Wind Cutter as soon as possible''', because it's your '''best early AoE skill with a Peuz set''' thanks to its amazing set bonus, it will help a TON for leveling. Also, don't forget that you can use [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12208/battle-manual Battle Manuals] to get a big increase on Eden board quests and Gramps quests.

* '''Lv 100'''
** At this level I always do the Rock Ridge main quest [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Rock_Ridge#Fistful_of_Zeny Fistful of Zeny]. It gives enough exp to get your first skill points, you get a free accessory good enough for beginners, and it's pretty easy to do. You may also do the daily quests for quick EXP everyday.
** Once you finished Rock Ridge, you can start doing the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Banquet_for_Heroes Banquet for Heroes] quests. You only need to walk and talk to NPCs until you get to [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Banquet_for_Heroes#Room_of_Consciousness Room of Consciousness]. This quest which contain an instance, will be too hard for you even though it's available at lvl 100; you need to ask for help from someone strong enough to solo it on #lfg. Once you've finished these, you may do the Royal Families quests and the dailies if you're still not 115. Another possibility is grinding at the ruins of Juperos, the dungeon is full of Venatus; you can start training your kiting skills here with Ignition Break, as they are quite unforgiving in mob trains since they are so many in there. It is recommended that you stay with the Neutral element as the Venatus have different elemental properties, depending on their color.
* '''Lv 115+'''
** When you get level 115, you can join the 2nd Gramps map and do the 400 mobs quests again there. If you want to get quickly to the 145+ Gramps tier, try getting an HE Battle Manual as it triples the EXP you earn; it only lasts 15 minutes so try to use it near the end of your 115+ Gramps run.
** If you're not satisfied with Gramps, you can always go back to Juperos. If the Venatus do not give much EXP anymore, you can try out Rachel Sanctuary with the Vanberks and Isillas. They're easier to kite than Venatus since they're much slower so you shouldn't have too much trouble there. Your only doom here is the Hodremlin, it bites hard; try to avoid it or take more distance between the mob train and yourself so you can have some time to kill the Hodremlin.
* '''Lv 145+'''
** Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests. The third map of Gramps should be pretty fast as there is usually a level max doing the map for one of his characters or friends in the team.
** You may also join the Charleston Crisis teams who run quite often the instance, to start farming up some items for your stuff (if you plan on getting an Excellion Suit) or to get money, while increasing your levels.
* '''Lv 160+'''
** At this level, you're pretty close to the max level (175), and you'll be able to join all the instances without prerequisite. Running them is a quick way to get the max level, as well as starting to farm for your items. What I usually do here, is run Room of Consciousness, Nightmarish Jitterbug, Charleston Crisis, Ghost Palace, Old Glast Heim Normal. If you cannot get into an instance team, go back to Gramps' 3rd level.
* '''Lv 175'''
** You did it ! Finally you're level 175, I'm proud of you grasshopper :>. It is now time to farm your stuff, and join bigger instances like Bios Island, Morse Cave, Temple of the Demon God, Old Glast Heim Hard... The rest is up to you ! ''If there are things you still don't understand or need more information, feel free to PM me on Discord (my ID is at the top of the guide).''
* '''Lv 175+'''
** If you are well-stuffed, you can try accessing some old endgame PvM contents such as Magma Dungeon F3, the Illusion Dungeons, Abyss Glast Heim, Gramps 175+... Another slower way is to keep on doing instances, because they usually reward you a nice amount of EXP either when you clear them or when you kill the MvP. '''Be careful as getting past level 175 is not needed for most contents and is usually pretty HARD on the new players. At this stage, I'd recommend instead that you grind for money and starting improving your gears.'''

If you got here then it means you have evolved to a Dragon Knight, congratulations ! You'll now be able to access the new stats system called traits, if you forgot how they work I recommend to check back the beginning of the guide in the Stats section. The traits will give you a nice power spike thanks to the impact of the POW stat both for its scaling in some 4th class skills and also mostly because of the P.ATK it gives. '''At this moment if you are still very poorly geared, you'll be facing a wall unless you get carried by EXP teams (which probably is the same thing that might have been happening on the previous levels too). In this case it is time that you give leveling a rest and focus on getting some basic gears (it could be at least a +9 Grace set that you can get for basically free [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Academy here], or some overrefined Illusion gears). The important is that you become able to hold your ground by yourself against enemies of content of endgame 3rd class content, so that you can check out easily instances and dungeons by yourself.'''

* '''Lv 200+'''
** At this level several possibilities are available; either you can try out the new 4th class maps (Niflheim Dungeon 1 or Rudus 4), either you can stick to some late endgame contents of 3rd classes like the last levels of Thanatos Tower which still give a good amount of EXP. If you die too much, you may want to join some leveling teams like the many Thanatos Tower 12 parties. After a dozen levels earnt on your character, you'll want to dump it all on the POW stat to get a big damage boost, whatever build you are currently running.
* '''Lv 215+'''
** On level 215 opens a singular new map which is Amiticia Dungeon; the density of monsters is not as good as Niflheim Dungeon or Thanatos Tower, but the monsters give correct EXP. Thus swapping to this map is not obligatory but it's available.
* '''Lv 230+'''
** After level 230 a dive in the earnt EXP will be noticed, it slows down pretty hard and it is usually recommended to run on Field Manuals at this point. It is an alright level to stop at if the grind gets too difficult for you, as you have access at this level to a maxed trait, which in our case should be POW at 100 for maximum damage boost. This and the potentially good new damage skills which can replace or complement your current main skill. If you want to keep on grinding though, you will want to head to the level 2 of Amiticia Dungeon.
* '''Lv 240+'''
** At 240 the exp requirement skyrockets once again, but if you are ready to keep going until the end you may want to swap to the second floor of the Niflheim dungeon.
