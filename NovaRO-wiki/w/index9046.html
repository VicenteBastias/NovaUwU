== Overview ==

[[File:StalkerSig.png|centre|frameless|250x180px]]


Hey everyone! My nickname is Chato ingame, and i'm a proud Shadow Chaser player from the Guild Casa do Pao de Queijo! I've been playing stalker for a good time, and now it's time for its 3rd class, Shadow Chasers.
On this guide, i hope to cover the basics of the class, show at least two famous builds and share some tips I or others have been using on this great class. Hope you will like it :D !

Almost every RPG has a rogue class, the one that is smart, fast, and somewhat tricky. This is Shadow Chasers in a nutshell.
If you think about the word versatility, you'd end up thinking about this class, and that's because it has a lot of potential and incites creativity.
If you don't know much about the class, you could summarize Shadow Chasers into a Trickster, making everyone's life harder on PvP/WoE environments, and being extremely versatile on PvM and PvP/WoE as well, since you can copy at least 2 different skills from other classes.
Being the "copy cat" it is, SCs don't perform as well as the original class it's copying the ability from, making this class more focused on PvP/WoE than PvM, but it still can put up a fight against monsters as well.

Now that we know at least some of the class, let's talk about Stats:
 

== Stats ==
Here we'll discuss a little bit about what every status is used for on different Shadow Chasers builds.

*'''STR''' - Strength is a really useful Status, it gives you more weight capacity, makes you tougher to some negative effects and gives you attack.

'' Auto Shadow Spell Builds:'' On this kind of build, you won't use strength much, being that your damage will come from MATK, so you'll only need it for weight capacity and resistances; 

'' PvP/WoE Builds:'' On player versus players scenarios, STR is a great status that everyone should have. Having a decent amount of str will give you weight capacity to carry your pots, equipment and etc, also making your difference between max weight and current weight bigger, lowering the chances you'll get masked by another SC;

'' Bow Builds:'' When using a bow, your damage will be heavily dependent on DEX, so having a little STR for the same reasons above is still important.

*'''AGI''' - Agility is an extremely important status for Shadow Chasers. Besides giving flee and ASPD, it also gives resistance to being masked, making it a essential status for almost every build.

'' Auto Shadow Spell Builds:'' The second most important status on this build. You'll need high ASPD to proc you automatic skills more, hence the need for high AGI;

'' PvP/WoE Builds:'' As said above, you'll need agi to do not get masked by others Chasers often, and also, the higher your ASPD is, the faster is you masking animation, making it more spammable with bragi and Instant Cast;

'' Bow Builds:'' Not so important here, since you'll be most likely using Triangle Shot or aimed bolt, but still great to have in medium amount.
  
*'''VIT''' - Vitality is really important on every build and every class. It gives you HP and Stun immunity when it's at least 100 base. 

''Auto Shadow Spell Builds:'' You'll have vitality here just to be increase your survival capability;

'' PvP/WoE Builds:'' As your role on WoE or PvP is mostly being a tank debuffing class, you will need a lot of HP to survive and make everyone's life worse. It's essential to have at least 100 vitality on this kind of build;

''Bow Builds:'' Same logic as ASS builds;

*'''INT''' - Intelligence gives you more SP, MATK, MDEF, SP recovery, cast reduction and resistance to Blind, Sleep and Chaos, besides being the most important status on Auto Shadow Spell builds.

''Auto Shadow Spell Builds:'' On ASS builds, you'll need a fair amount of MATK to deal damage with your skills that you copied, so the greater the amount of intelligence, the better;

'' PvP/WoE Builds:'' Even if it doesn't look like, int is extremely important for this kind of build, because your aim is to get Instant Cast or at least very close to it, and int is going to help you with that;

''Bow Builds:'' You will need at least some SP for PvM, and if you're using aimed bolt, int helps you get closer to IC.

*'''DEX''' - Dex was a great status for Stalkers, and still is for Chasers. The greater the dex, the higher is your chance to land a mask on someone, besides that, Dex is the main status to get if you're looking for reaching Instant Cast.

''Auto Shadow Spell Builds:'' On this build, you need to hit the monsters in order to proc you automatic skills, so having Dex is necessary to increase you HIT status;

'' PvP/WoE Builds:'' As said before, you'll need A LOT of this. A Chaser with a good amount of dex have a much easier life landing masks, full striping someone and using casting skills;

''Bow Builds:'' The main status of this build, since it's what influences in your damage.

*'''LUK''' - Luck is a secondary status for Chasers. It will help you get some perfect dodge, resistance to negative status effects and increasing a bit your ATK and MATK.

''Auto Shadow Spell Builds:'' Good to have in a moderate amount, increasing you MATK;

'' PvP/WoE Builds:'' Not bad if you're looking for resisting some negative status;

''Bow Builds:'' Honestly sub-par, try to have at least a little bit to give you some ATK.

== Skills ==
Here, we'll cover only what '''most important''' skills do.  

''Tips on how to use them and gameplay will be discussed later in this guide.'' 
=== First Job Skills ===
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!Skill
!Notes
|-
|{{Skill List |id=51|skill=Hiding}}
|Really useful skill. You can use it to dodge other players skills and hide from monsters.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=49 |skill=Improved Dodge}}
|Always nice to have a little bit of dodge, it can save your life.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=150 |skill=Backslide}}
|Really great skill for its mobility. You can use it to mob monsters for your party, escape players or skills on pvp or get to them using /bangbang or /bingbing to re position yourself.
|}

=== Second/Trans Job Skills ===
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!Skill
!Notes
|-
|{{Skill List |id=225|skill=Intimidate}}
|One of the identities of this class. Intimidate is the skill that allows you to copy the latest skill that hit you. What skill to copy varies on your build. Normally, you can copy almost all pre-3rd skills that hit you with a few exceptions.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=213 |skill=Stalk}}
|Enables movement while hiding, useful skill that will be replaced by others.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=44 |skill=Vulture's Eye}}
|If you're using a bow build, it's a essential passive to have, giving you more range.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2 |skill=Sword Mastery}}
|Good to have if you're going with a Psychical damage build.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=476 |skill=Full Divestment}}
|Great Skill to have on PvP environment, must have for this situation. Not so useful for pure WoE builds since you won't have a lot of time to divest people and most will be using Full Chemical Protection.  
|-
|{{Skill List |id=389 |skill=Chase Walk}}
|Really great skill, enables movement while hiding and makes you undetectable by detectable skills. Any AoE will reveal you however. 
|}

=== Third Job Skills ===
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
!Skill
!Notes
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2303|skill=Bloody Lust}}
|Creates a 7x7 red circle on the ground that makes every character that steps on it enter the frenzy status. In other words, use it to drain everyone's SP.

A great situational skill with a noticeable CD that can be game changing depending on how you use it. Great to break precasts or drain SP from someone that is trapped. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2289 |skill=Body Painting}}
|Reveals everyone that is hiding within a 5x5 are from you. Great skill against Hiding classes or people who use Smokie Card.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2301 |skill=Chaos Painting}}
|Inflict Chaos on a 5x5 area. Great for WoE and BG. Try to put it in small areas or entrances/exits to get people off guard.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=5010 |skill=Escape}}
|Great mobility skill! When used, makes your character back a number of cells and leaves a trap on where you were.

You can use combos to trap people or monsters. A must have skill.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2304 |skill=Feint Bomb}}
|One of the best skills to survive on WoE and PvP. Makes your character backs a number of cells like Escape but you'll be in hiding status AND able to use skills while in it.

Really great skill to have, making you able to jump on a whole precast and survive if played right. You can use your masks or any other skill, so make use of that feature.  
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2290 |skill=Invisibility}}
|A tricky skill to use. What this skill does is that you enter in a complete hiding status, and can't be revealed, but will take damage from AoE attacks. While in this status, your SP will be drained constantly and you attacks will have ghost property.

Some Chasers use it to break emps with bows.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2302 |skill=Maelstrom}}
|Works like a mini Land Protector, absorbing ground skills. It's important to notice that you or others stalkers can't use faint bomb while stepping on this skill, so be careful on how to use it. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2299 |skill=Manhole}}
|Creates a hole on the ground that will trap any character that walks on it. While trapped the character can't get attacked, but you can use shadow form on him and try to be tricky.

Same logic as chaos painting, try to predict where anyone would go and put your manhole there. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2293 |skill=Masquerade-Gloomy}}
|One of the most used masks. Knwon for removing target's mount or homunculus. Use it on Dragon Breath RKs and watch they use butterfly wing on WoE :D. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2294 |skill=Masquerade-Ignorance}}
|Makes your target unable to use skills for a certain time and drains some of their SP. The description should be enough to give you the idea of how good is this skill.

This is the mask that every Chaser should use first, unless the target is an DB Rk. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2297 |skill=Masquerade-Weakness}}
|The third of the most used masks. Masq. Weakness removes your target Shield and Weapon, making it a defenseless easy target to your team.

It's important to notice that even if your target is using Full Chemical Protection, if you land your mask, he'll have his weapon and shield taken. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce}}
|The intimidate Skill from 3rd Job. This awesome skill makes you able to copy 3rd class skills that hits you.

The skills copied varies from build to build. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2287 |skill=Shadow Form}}
|Makes your target take the damage you'd receive. Useful to get combo suras offguard, tanking asuras or any incoming damage.

The amount of people that die to Shadow Form is impressive. You should train the use of this skill. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=(Auto)Shadow Spell}}
|When attacking with a sword or dagger, the skills that you learned through Intimidate or Reproduce can be cast automatically. A whole build is based on this skill.

There are some things you need to know about it:

You can't cast holy spells except heal and spells that are both magic and physical.

If the skill you copied need items to be used, you'd still need them when using ASS.

The higher lvl ASS is, the probability of the automatic cast is lower, but the copied skill level is higher, so you'll have to find a balance between probability and damage when deciding what lvl of ASS you're going to be using.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot}}
|One source of DPS for Bow builds. Shots 3 arrows on a target.
|}

== Equipment ==
Here's the part where we discuss about what equipment you should/could get.
There will be 3 builds that we're going to take a look at: WoE/PvP support build, ASS and Bow Chaser.

I'll be focusing more on WoE build, being the one that i have experience the most, but we'll get through other builds ideas.


=== WoE/PvP ===
----

[[File:StalkerWoEGear.png|centre|frameless|278x184px]]

In this section we talk about the most famous Sc build. Even though this class is really capable of putting up a fight on PvM, is at PvP where it shines.

Keep in mind that the '''goal with this build is to distribute the most CC and debuff as possible''', so our goal is to be really '''tanky''', and survive enough to break a defense or be useful for your team.

This is the build i have the most experience with of all the 3, and right now we're gonna go trough all its necessary equipment, from basic to luxury:

=== Headgears: ===

Getting your hat is probably the easiest part of this build. There isn't much left besides {{Item List |id=5170 |item=Feather Beret}}. It gives you 10% reduced damage from humans and +1 MDEF that comes in handy.

You can get Feather Beret by giving Sakjul (Rachel 152, 131) a {{Item List |id=5172 |item=Beret}}, 100 {{Item List |id=7063 |item=Soft Feather}} and 1 {{Item List |id=982 |item=White Dyestuffs}}. ''Obs: There's a 10% chance to fail this quest. You'll lose all items if that happens D:'' .

As for middle and Lower, we're gonna be using {{Item List |id=5800 |item=Blush of Groom}} and {{Item List |id=5377 |item=Gentleman's Pipe}}, both giving you 5% defense from humanoid.

I do use {{Item List |id=5574 |item=Well-Chewed Pencil Shield}} just for achieving the exact number to hit IC when buffed. 

{{Item List |id=5800 |item=Blush of Groom}}, {{Item List |id=5377 |item=Gentleman's Pipe}} and {{Item List |id=5574 |item=Well-Chewed Pencil Shield}} can be obtained via Cash Shop.

=== Weapons ===

The '''best''' weapon you can get right now is {{Item List |id=1228 |item=Combat Knife}} (drops from LHZ boss Sniper Cecil) for defensive purposes. It gives you 10% defense from Demihuman and can get enchanted in Malangdo.

When enchanting it, you should aim for double Dex, to boost your chances to land a debuff and get closer to IC.

If you can't afford a CK right now, you could get your hands on a {{Item List |id=1223 |item=Fortune Sword}} (you can get it from Phreeoni) and enchant it on Malangdo as well.

=== Shields ===

About shields, there's a choice to make: Immune Shield or Valk?

I personally choose {{Item List |id=2115 |item=Valkyrja's Shield |slots= 1}} for its '''elemental defense'''  and '''MDEF''', but {{Item List |id=2168 |item=Immune Shield |slots= 1}} is a nice option as well if it's +7 or more and great at +9.

Both items are easy to obtain, Valk Shield is really cheap (~5m) and Immune Shield can be obtained via Proof of Loyalty, Monster Hunt cupons and Valor Badges (Battleground currency).

With those items, you should use the classic {{Card |id=4058 Thara Frog Card}} for its Humanoid defense.

=== Armor, Garment and Shoes ===

With the presence of WoE Set ingame, there's not much that you can do about it, this is the best defense you could get by using its set and set effect. Also, the set effect gives you DEX, and that's the Stat that is always good to have as a Chaser.

Right, {{Item List |id=15047 |item=WoE Suits |slots= 1}} doesn't need to be +9 right away, it also gives you a bonus when +6. This is probably the most expensive item from the basic build when +9, but it's definitely worht it!

Continuing with the woe set, we get {{Item List |id=2484 |item=WoE Boots |slots= 1}} and {{Item List |id=2586 |item=WoE Manteau |slots= 1}}. Those are great items, all of them give nice resistances and have slots, making you really tank. I wouldn't recommend going WoE with a tank mindset if you're not using WoE set.

As for cards, you should get {{Card |id=4105 Marc Card}} on armor, giving you protection against freeze status and resistance to water which is great. 

There are other options as well: If your build consists of having 100 MDEF or you think you just don't need freeze immunity, you can always use {{Card |id=4031 Pecopeco Card}} for its +10% max HP.

For those with funds, {{Card |id=4045 Ghostring Card}} for defense against Asuras, Hell's Plants and such or {{Card |id=4054 Angeling Card}} because it gives you Holy 1 property, reducing almost all elemental damage by 25%.

For Garment you can get a few options to put in your {{Item List |id=2586 |item=WoE Manteau |slots= 1}} : {{Card |id=4133 Raydric Card}} for its neutral defense, good against Asura or any other hight neutral damage, {{Card |id=4334 Noxious Card}} for an all around good defense (my personal choice) and if you do have money on your pocket, a {{Card |id=4174 Deviling Card}} instead of a Raydric to be really tanky against neutral.

Talking about {{Item List |id=2484 |item=WoE Boots |slots= 1}}, a great card is {{Card |id=4381 Green Ferus Card}}. It's simple and direct: VIT+1 and 10% HP.

=== Accessories ===

About accessories we do have a few choices:

The ones that will give you the most '''elemental defense''' are {{Item List |id=2772 |item=Glorious Rings}}. They're great and my favorites. With them, tanking Tetra Vortex, Dragon Breath or any other common elemental damage skill that wee see at woe is much easier. You can get those by playing Battlegrounds and farming Valor Badges, costing 1200 each.

Other option of Accessories that are easy to get is {{Item List |id=2898 |item=Black Rosary |slots= 1}}, an basic but good accessory that will give you some MDEF and you could equip {{Card |id=4252 Alligator Card}} on.

Another good accessories that aren't that easy to put your hands on are {{Item List |id=2981 |item=Hero Rings}}, which look bad when taking a lookt at them first but become very interesting when we talk about the type of enchantments it can get.

''You can get your {{Item List |id=2981 |item=Hero Rings}} by doing Bios Island, Morse Cave and Temple of Demon God instances and obtaining '''Token of Hero'''. For futher explanation, check NovaWiki's guides about them.''

With these bad boys you can get up to +5 on any status (Being the better ones VIT or DEX), +5% ATK or MATK (that doesn't matter too much), +5% MAX HP and +15 DEF or  +5 MDEF.

----

=== Auto Shadow Spell Build ===


----

[[File:AutoShadowSpellStalker.png|centre|frameless|278x192px]]

This is more of a For fun PvM build for Chasers that is really cool. It consists on the use of ASS and other items that generate automatic skill proc, infesting your screen with multiple skills.

The Goal with this build is to achieve 193 ASPD or somewhere closer to that, increasing the chance of the skill proc, and have a lot of MATK to increase the damage of your auto skills.

I do not recommend this build if you just entered the game/server. It's for fun and you'll need some equipment to achieve its general goal.

=== Headgear ===

For starters, '''one of the best pure MATK hats''' we get is {{Item List |id=18848 |item=Vibrant Rose |slots= 1}}, that can be upgrade to {{Item List |id=18849 |item=Celine's Ribbon |slots= 1}} ''(Good luck with that)''. 
You have to gather 500 {{Item List |id=7642 |item=Bloody Coin}}s in order to get that hat, and to upgrade it to Celine spend 1000 more and have a +9 Vibrant Rose ready.

''For more info about that check NovaWiki's Horror Toy Factory Guide.''

Another option that was '''made exclusively''' for this build is {{Item List |id=5904 |item=Inconspicuous Hat |slots= 1}} which is already great at +7 and awesome at +9. You can get this one for 5,000 cash points.

I believe those 3 are the better ones for this build, but you could still use {{Item List |id=18539 |item=Skull Cap |slots= 1}} if you already have one with good refine.

For middle headgear, you'll find two simple options as {{Item List |id=18611 |item=Black Frame Glasses |slots= 1}} (The original one from Cash Shop doesn't have a slot, so you'd need to buy a Spiritual Auger and slot it) being the expensive option or {{Item List |id=5389 |item=Angel Spirit}} as a more affordable one.

Talking about lower headgear, the one that '''has the best synergy with this build''' is by far {{Item List |id=18666 |item=CD in Mouth}}. It'll randomly proc elemental bolts when you're attacking psychically. ''You can get this item from Cash Shop as well''.

For cards i'd recommend {{Card |id=4412 Isila Card}} and/or {{Card |id=4366 Kathryne Keyron Card}} if you have a well refined Hat.


=== Weapons ===

Briefly talking about Weapons, we can point two that excel on this build:

The first one and '''my pick''' is {{Item List |id=13414 |item=Elemental Sword |slots= 3}}. This sword works in a approximate way of CD in Mouth, being that it will proc bolts starting with cold bolt always.

Besides having 3 slots, which is already great, this weapon has a lot of synergy with the build and with a good refine can achieve a lot. ''You'll find this sword on market for low prices''.

If you don't want to invest on a Elemental Sword, your other option is getting a {{Item List |id=13090 |item=Faceworm Queen Leg |slots= 2}}, a dagger that drops from the Faceworm's Nest instance and you can also buy it for a relative low price on market.

For cards, you can use '''A LOT''' of them, and it depends on the skills that you're using with auto shadow spell.

For example, there's {{Card |id=4380 Red Ferus Card}} if you're using Meteor Storm, {{Card |id=4117 Sidewinder Card}} if you're using elemental Sword, {{Card |id=4203 Mutant Dragonoid Card}}, {{Card |id=4320 Bloody Knight Card}}, {{Card |id=4425 Atroce Card}} (if you're lucky or have money to spend) and {{Card |id=4318 Stormy Knight Card}} (same situation as Atroce card).

=== Shields ===

My pick for shields is {{Item List |id=2124 |item=Thorny Buckler |slots= 1}} that you can combo with {{Item List |id=2702 |item=Bison Horn |slots= 1}} and get a little bit of ASPD, a essential status for this build.

If you're not comfortable with this shield, there's always the good and old {{Item List |id=2115 |item=Valkyrja's Shield |slots= 1}}.

With that, i'd recommend a simple {{Card |id=4413 Hodremlin Card}}.


=== Armor, Garment and Shoes ===

'''For armor''', you'll have some variety of options. The truth is that there's no excellent armor for this build, maybe the closest to that is {{Item List |id=15097 |item=Hero Hidden Cloth |slots= 1}} for its great passive.

'' You can get those "hero armors" by completing Bios Island and Morse Cave, check out this wiki's guides about it.''

There's also {{Item List |id=2357 |item=Valkyrian Armor |slots= 1}} that drops from Valkyrie Boss and {{Item List |id=2365 |item=Olean's Gown |slots= 1}} that you can get from Banshee monsters.

The offensive card option for armor is {{Card |id=4426 Byorgue Card}}.

'''About garments''', there's two really good options to choose from: One is getting a good (Int or agi) {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Faceworm Skin |slots= 1}} that will give you '', if it's +12,'' ASPD and MATK depending on the enchants, and the other one is the famous {{Item List |id=2576 |item=Heroic Backpack |slots= 1}} that if refined to +7 or +9 is really good, besides being easily obtainable. (You'll find them on Battleground Shop, Proof of Loyalty shop and Monster Hunt Shop).

You can equip {{Card |id=4595 Cenere Card}} if you need more ASPD or {{Card |id=4596 Antique Book Card}} if more damage is needed.

When talking '''boots''', there's one type of boot that is awesome, and it is the '''Temporal Boots'''.

Now, before choosing which you're going to use, you need to calculate how you're gonna get high ASPD. If you have already enough ways to obtain that, go for a {{Item List |id=22001 |item=Temporal Int Boots |slots= 1}}, if not, then {{Item List |id=22002 |item=Temporal Agi Boots |slots= 1}} is your answer!

''In order to get Temporal Boots, you need to farm at Old Glast Heim in both normal and hard difficulties. Check NovaWiki's guide about this instance.''

You can use {{Card |id=4381 Green Ferus Card}} for some HP, or if you have funds, the best option is {{Card |id=31017 Outrageous Cookie Card}} on a well refined pair of boots.

=== Accessories ===

Let's start with cheap options: you can try to use the {{Item List |id=2678 |item=Ring of Flame Lord}} and {{Item List |id=2679 |item=Ring of Resonance}} combo that drops from Ifrit.

If using {{Item List |id=2124 |item=Thorny Buckler |slots= 1}}, then {{Item List |id=2702 |item=Bison Horn |slots= 1}} is your go to.

Now for more expensive options, we have {{Item List |id=2992 |item=Pendant Of Maelstrom |slots= 1}} and {{Item List |id=2910 |item=Bakonawa Agimat Tattoo}} that you can get by doing Nightmarish Jitterbug instance and Baknonawa Festival respectively. ''Check NovaWiki's guides about them''.

For cards, a simple option is go to {{Card |id=4505 Scaraba Card}} or if needed more specific upgrades {{Card |id=4433 Imp Card}} and {{Card |id=4416 Siroma Card}}.


----


=== Bow Chasers ===


----


Unfortunately, this is a build that i, and many others, don't explore much, but it exists! 

So i'll give a brief overview of key equipment, though it won't be as detailed as above.

---- 

Basically, what you need to achieve in this build is high amount of DEX and equips that grant Long Ranged Damage and ATAK.

Here are a few examples: 

{{Item List |id=5359 |item=Ship Captain Hat |slots= 1}} or {{Item List |id=18570 |item=Ancient Gold Ornament |slots= 1}} with a {{Card |id=4468 Dark Pinguicula Card}}

{{Item List |id=5325 |item=Robo Eye}}

{{Item List |id=5361 |item=Gangster Scarf}}


Two great weapons to use are {{Item List |id=1734 |item=Orc Archer Bow}} and a well refined {{Item List |id=18130 |item=Crimson Bow|slots= 2}}.

''Just don't forget to use {{Item List |id=1753 |item=Steel Arrow}} with your Orc Archer Bow!''


'''The idea about armors and garment is the same as above on the Auto Shadow Spell Build''' , just changing the statuses to Dex instead of Int.

A great card for garment is undoubtedly {{Card |id=4593 Menblatt Card}}.


For '''boots''' the idea is the same, only it's a '''Temporal Dex Boots''' instead.

And for accessories the goal is to put your hands on a {{Item List |id=2992 |item=Pendant Of Maelstrom |slots= 1}} or {{Item List |id=2910 |item=Bakonawa Agimat Tattoo}} as well, using two {{Card |id=4508 Gold Scaraba Card}}s.

== Builds ==


[[File:StalkerBuildCalculations.png|centre|frameless|416x203px]]



Here will be shown just general aspects of the status build. Each should decide precisely what exact status to put in their build. 

It will be listed the most important skills to use on each build as well. '''Gameplay will be discussed in the next section'''.

'''Key skills are:''' The three masks: Ignorance, Weakness and Gloomy.

Manhole, Chaos Panic, Bloody Lust and Maelstrom.

As for copied skills, you have a few options: Flying kick is almost mandatory, it gives you a unreal mobility and chase potential, as for the others, there's Windmill from Sura, Diamond Dust from Sorcerer, Crazy Weed from Creators and Jackfrost from Warlocks. All of them are useful skills to land a CC or support your team.

----

== Gameplay ==

Here in this section, '''i'll be featuring quick tips and tricks about the class on WoE/PvP scenarios''', since it's the build i'm most comfortable at. Given that, we'll be using the WoE/PvP build.

But before that, i'll reiterate what was said before about your role as a WoE/PvP Chaser:

It's important to accept that Shadow Chasers are a Supportive class, but as i like to call, offensive support. Your job is to protect your team or invade the enemy lines, and for that, you should be quick using masks and your two best friends: Escape and Feint Bomb.

On WoE, you have to act accordingly to your guild strategy, being protecting your friends from other stalkers (you can always use Maelstrom to disable the use of the enemy's Feint Bomb) or attacking the enemy backline, is always important to maintain focus as a Stalker. Know your primary targets and don't stop! You have 3 mobility skills on your disposal, so make it hard to people to target you by never being in the same spot for more than 2 seconds.

If your enemy isn't getting masked, '''be creative''', don't waste your time repeating actions. Try another masks, other CCs you might have or just change targets.

Besides that, be careful with your cooldowns. You have a lot of debuffs, think if it's really necessary using that specific one before burning its CD.

That's just a few thoughts about your behavior as a Stalker, and should we all get lucky at WoE/PvP!!

=== Where to get Paints? ===

First of all, to use most of our skill, Stalkers need to use Surface Paint and Face Paint. Here's a quick way of obtaining them:

[[File:StalkerPaintGuide.png|centre|frameless|1050x613px]]

----

=== Flying Kick + Escape trick ===

This is one of the most used tricks as a Shadow Chaser, allowing you to quickly root your target and be really annoying.

Notice that escape can be a bit buggy sometimes when the target is moving, so that will make it harder to land.

What you actually do is just click Flying kick on your target and quickly press Escape.

''Try to use different levels of Escape to go different distances and find one you're comfortable with''

[[File:StalkerFKEscape3.gif|centre|frameless|320x240px]]


----


=== Manhole positioning ===

If you came from other server or is new to using this skill, know that Manhole have a different positioning.

You can't actually put it under people, making it harder to land. You will need to predict your target's path or put it in an area that someone will certainly step on it.

Here's an image showing where you can start putting Manholes. 

[[File:StalkerManhole.png|centre|frameless|352x196px]]


----

=== Little Feint Bomb + Masquerade interaction ===

As said before, one of the great things about Feint Bomb is that you can use skills while on hiding status, making you untouchable and useful at the same time.

Considering that, if you use your Feint Bomb on lvl 1, you'll have enough range to still be in hiding and cast a Mask on your target, making it a core easy combo.

[[File:StalkerFBMasq2.gif|centre|frameless|320x240px]]

== Leveling ==
Leveling isn't that great with a stalker. You can try it with ASS and Bow build but it won't be as strong as other more pvm focused classes.

If you can, dual client with a Ranger or ask kindly for one of your friends help.

Recommended Places:
*'''Lv1 - Lv30'''
**Payon Dungeon it is. Start by killing Zombies and then when feeling confident go for Poporings and Skeletons. Try to use Holy elemental damage (From Aspersio or Silver Arrow). 

*'''Lv31 - Lv70'''
**Now it's time to go to Orc's Dungeon.

This is a great map for mobbing, almost all monsters are aggressive and there are a lot of them on the map. Try to use Holy elemental damage (From Aspersio or Silver Arrow). 

*'''Lv70 - Lv85'''
** You can go to Magmarings map (Warper > Dungeon > Thor Volcano > Enter the exit portal) with a Archer dual/friend using Water element. The exp here is great.
** If you don't want to go to Magmarings, you can get your eden quests to Kill Evil Druids and Wraiths. They are repetitive, so do it until you're 85.

*'''Lv85 - Lv175''' 
** From now on things get really stabilized. The best exp outcome from 85 to max level is doing Gramps (Turn ins) that are Eden Group quests that consist of killing 400 monsters on a special map. You'll be given 2 types of monsters to kill and can enter with a party on this map. Being extremely recommended that you do this quest on a party.

There are 3 ranges of gramps: 85-114, 115-144 and 145-175.

'''Don't forget to always check Eden Quest Boards. They'll help you tremendously on leveling and can be done when your gramps is on CD.'''

== Thank you! ==

That's it for now! I hope that with this guide you guys have a brief idea of how this class works, and accessed some of the initial information one would need to start playing it!

It's been fun writing this. If anything, contact me ingame or Discord (vTours). Cya!!
