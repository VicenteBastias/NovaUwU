= Who am i? =

Hello everyone, my name is primal fear and i play on nova RO since april 2016.
I've played a lot of classes like mechanic, Rune Knight, Rebellion but my main class for pvp is sura.

Some people may know under those names : Hooligan fury, SeyrenWindsor, CecilDamon...

= Acronym and vocabulary =
I'll use few abreviations for this guide :

'''GOH'''  = Gate of Hell (ranged dps skill)

'''TC'''   = Tiger cannon (melee dps skill)

'''Snap''' = Body relocation (monk skill)

'''CC'''   = Cursed circle (sura crowd control skill)

'''CS'''   = Crushing strike (RK runes)

'''PvM'''   = Player versus Monster

'''PvP'''   = Player versus Player

'''RK'''   = Rune Knight

'''RG'''   = Royal Guard

'''EoE'''  = Essence of Evil, a drop that give stats and goes in card slot. obtainable in temple of the demon god instance.

'''OGH'''  = Old glast heim instance
 
= Stats =
Sura have a lots of builds and stats change widely. Most of the time you'll put them according to the temporal boots you use.
*'''STR''' - Your main dps stats for a lots of build, however, due to temporal boots bonus, you wont put more than 100-110
*'''AGI''' - Usefull stat for most of builds, it increase attack speed and give you ability to use skills faster (such as snap). 60-110
*'''VIT''' - Increase your HP, and status resistance such as stun. Very important stats since most of your dps skill use HP pool. 100-120
*'''INT''' - This stats is mostly to increase asura since its damage is proportional to your SP pool. 40-110
*'''DEX''' - Increase HIT and decrease cast time, also decrease delay between combo. important for TC / GOH build. 100-120
*'''LUK''' - Increase your ATK but less than STR does, 20-40

== Leveling ==

===1-85===

That's the boring part, i recommand you to do the eden quest and farm place such as orc donjon and glast heim church with aspersio buff. Use fingers offensive skill to kill monster.

===85-85 rebirth===

Do both of the gramps quest, DONT get the rewards yet (you'll be 99 before finishing them). Before rebirth go make one of the 90-99 eden quest (such as turtle donjon quest).
 
Now you can rebirth, go kill few poring to pass acolyte, then take the reward of the eden quest : that will make you instant 50 job level. 

Change job to champion and take gramps's reward, it will bring you straight to sura.

===85-175===

Gramps! Gramps all the way, there is no better way to level. Exept if you are rich and can afford full asura gear and tones of bloody branch to level on MVP.

The best build for gramps imo is SNAP! there is so many classes who have better dps than you and it doesnt drain their hp / sp. 

Just snap over the map, make hugeee mobtrain and bring it back to your team. That will make your mates happy.

===Solo leveling===

You can chose to level solo and take time to learn the class before you start doing serious things.

Here is an exemple of cheap build you can make to kill tones of mobs and regenerating ur hp / sp as well :

[[File:Suraleveling.jpeg]]

Head : rideword hat or Vanargand Helm, middle and lower doesnt matter.

Armor : glorious suit for max HP.

Weapon : Thanatos Mace have better size bonus than knuckle, put an hunter fly card in.

Shield : Platinium shield are cheap and very usefull, provide 15% resistance to middle and large size monster.

Garment : any slotted GSS with raydric card.

Boots : Any slotted temporal vit shoes with green ferus or raydric card. You can use variant shoes or E variant shoes instead.

Accessory : doesnt matter much, best is pendant of maelstrom. Silverwork Bracelet are cheap and give nice bonus.


This equipment is for tiger cannon build cause it does massive AOE damage. Take flash combo in your build, use flash combo if you can kill the mob with a normal TC, or do a manual combo if you need more damage. Dont forget TC can be endowed!

Here you have a video of a sura leveling with TC in scaraba hole =>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wz-SNlYH2U]

===Hybrid DPS===

*'''Equipment''' 

Head : {{Item List |id=5208 |item=Rideword Hat|simple=yes}} for regen or {{Item List |id=5359 |item=Ship Captain Hat|simple=yes}} for GoH damage or {{Item List |id=18765 |item=Enhanced Corsair|simple=yes}} for TC damage. EoE vit 3 is a good choice for a card.

Armor : {{Item List |id=2394 |item=Glorious Suit|simple=yes}} is one of the best overall {{Item List |id=15041 |item=Boitata Armor [1]|simple=yes}} is very good too, add 7% neutral resistance and hp + slot
{{Item List |id=15052 |item=Bayani Bakunawa Scale Armor [1]|simple=yes}} is ok choice because of the +2 all stats it give. Put a peco peco card in the armor

Weapon : {{Item List |id=16033 |item=Robot's Mechanical Arm [2] |simple=yes}} > {{Item List |id=16003 |item=Carga Mace [2] |simple=yes}} > {{Item List |id=1544 |item=Lunakaligo [3] |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=16028 |item=Thanatos Hammer [1]  |simple=yes}} for regen. Put white knight card from OGH instance in those weapons, mixed with archer skeleton for GoH, or abysmal knight if you fight MVP.

Shield :  {{Item List |id=2189 |item=+7 Mad Bunny Shield [1]  |simple=yes}} is the best for DPS, coupled with Khalitzburg knight card from OGH. {{Item List |id=2168 |item=+7 Immune Shield [1]  |simple=yes}} is also good for tanking.

Garment :  {{Item List |id=20717 |item=+8 - +12 Gigant Snake Skin [1]  |simple=yes}} try to get a cheap one with usefull bonus (str / vit). Use raydric card

Shoes :  {{Item List |id=22006 |item=Temporal Boots Of Strength [1]  |simple=yes}} is the best compromise between all the temporal boots, just be sure to have 120 STR base. Carded with green ferus card

*'''Skill tree'''

[[File:Hybrid.jpg]]

*'''Stats'''

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 100
*'''VIT''' 105
*'''INT''' 50
*'''DEX''' 100
*'''LUK''' 20

===Full asura MVP===

This stuff is very complex, it have to maximize your SP pool while having a great amound of ATK. With a such build you can easily reach 800k asura on any MVP.

*'''Equipment''' 

Head : Any slotted hat with {{Item List |id=4269 |item=Incubus Card  |simple=yes}}.

Middle Headgear : {{Item List |id=18874 |item=Cyclops Glasses [1]  |simple=yes}} with  {{Item List |id=4269 |item=Incubus Card  |simple=yes}}, it will give +200 max SP.

Lower Headgear : {{Item List |id=5361 |item=Gangster Scarf  |simple=yes}}

Garment and Shoes :

*'''Tips'''

I dont use anti break cast gear, your cast should be fast enough to proc asura strike before mobs interrupt you.

Use change as gentle touch.

Dont forget you cant asura strike right after snap, you have 2sec cooldown.

*'''Stats'''

*'''STR''' 120 (add ATK)
*'''AGI''' 1
*'''VIT''' 80  (for stun resist)
*'''INT''' 120 (more SP)
*'''DEX''' 100 (Cast time decrease)
*'''LUK''' 20  (Add some ATK for few stats point)

===Tank Sura===

One of the most common roles of a sura in instance is to tank the MVP, due to steel body skill that reduce every damage income per 90% for a long duration.

Stats and skill are not important for this, you just want to maximize your HP with vit and maybe get some flee with agi.

*'''Equipment''' 

*Decent :

Head : {{Item List |id=5363 |item=Helm Of Abyss [1] |simple=yes}} add 10% reduc to boss monter

Armor : {{Item List |id=2394 |item=Glorious Suit|simple=yes}} for HP pool, cheap

Shield :  {{Item List |id=2168 |item=+7 Immune Shield [1]  |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=2115 |item=+4 Valkyrja's Shield [1] [1]  |simple=yes}} with alice card

Garment :  {{Item List |id=20743 |item=+4 Cloak Of Airship [1]  |simple=yes}} free 10% neutral resist, carded with raydric

Shoes :  {{Item List |id=2423 |item= Variant Shoes |simple=yes}} for max hp, you can get it for one million zeny.

Accessory : {{Item List |id=2772 |item=Glorious ring   |simple=yes}} add elemental resistance, always good

*High end (godlike) :

This stuff will basically make you feel like you are in Steel body even if you'r not :

Head : {{Item List |id=5529 |item=Satanic Bone Helm [1] |simple=yes}} add 5% neutral resistance

Armor : {{Item List |id=15041 |item=Boitata Armor [1]|simple=yes}} Best armor for tanking, add 7% neutral résistance, 5% hp and slot. With peco peco card or angeling card if you fight no-dark MVP

Shield :  {{Item List |id=2168 |item=+9 Immune Shield [1]  |simple=yes}} a +9 one will give you 9% neutral resistance. With Abysmal knight card

Garment :  {{Item List |id=2576 |item=+9 Heroic Backpack [1]  |simple=yes}} coupled with deviling card, this garment will bring you 65% neutral resistance!!

Shoes : {{Item List |id=22014 |item= Enhanced Variant Shoes [1]   |simple=yes}} with green ferus card

Accessory : {{Item List |id=2772 |item=Glorious ring   |simple=yes}} add elemental resistance

With this stuff you reach 86% neutral resistance, add 40% reduction from alice card and 25% reduction from your 200 hard DEF. 

For example if randgris give you a lvl 50 brandish spear at 10 000 base damage, you'll get 10000*(1/0.86)*(1/0.4)*(1/0.25) = 630 damage '''WITHOUT STEEL BODY'''. If you are under steel body, you'll take 630*(1-0.9)= 63 damage...
