== Disclaimer ==
This guide is intended to be used in NovaRO. While you may find the information here useful for other servers, you may not find the same gears or features that are implemented in NovaRO. Since I have only played Oboro, most of the knowledge on Kagerou’s three exclusive skills are based on available information online that I have reviewed before making this guide. Furthermore, this guide will mostly cover PVM aspect of Kagerou/Oboro while briefly touching the PVP aspect. I highly recommend looking at Nosher’s guide [http://novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/1095-unveiling-the-shadows-a-kagerouoboro-analysis/ Unveiling the Shadows - A Kagerou/Oboro analysis] for more detailed analysis on PVP and list of known bugs in NovaRO with regard to Kagerou and Oboro. Some of the builds mentioned here are inspired from ideas in the previously mentioned guide and its discussion thread.

== Overview ==
Kagerou and Oboro are the 2nd job classes for Ninja. While Kagerou and Oboro have the drawbacks of not being able to transcend (less allocable stat points, smaller HP pool) and get transcendent only gears, they are quite strong and may be able to compete damage wise with the regular 3rd job classes, especially since we can achieve level 175/60 and have access to the same end-game items (such as: [[Temporal Boots]], [[Faceworm Skins]], {{item |id=2576  &lt;nowiki>Heroic Backpack [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}, WoE Gears, etc.) here in NovaRO. Furthermore, Kagerou and Oboro have very niche and useful skills which significantly increase their survivability. In fact, it is not unheard-of to see a Kagerou/Oboro/Ninja standing unscathed during a party wipe on end-game dungeons and instances. 
If you have played ninja previously in pre-renewal, the playstyle of Kagerou/Oboro will be very familiar to you. While keeping the distinct playstyle and flavor of the beloved ninja class, Kagerou/Oboro receive massive steroids to boost their damage capabilities and another survival trick at their disposal.

There are three builds that I will cover in this guide: Magic, Throwing, and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke]/[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw].  While there are definitely other builds available such as the melee Kagerou and Oboro, I have only tried the three that I have mentioned.

== Kagerou vs Oboro ==
This is probably one of your biggest question when you decide to make this class. While most of their core skills are shared between the two of them, their three exclusive skills set them apart. Kagerou is able to learn [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Empty_Shadow Empty Shadow], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Trampling Shadow Trampling] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Warrior Shadow Warrior] while Oboro receives [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ominous_Moonlight Ominous Moonlight] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Moonlight_Fantasy Moonlight Fantasy].

In my opinion, Kagerou is more tailored for PVP environment due to their [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Trampling Shadow Trampling] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Empty_Shadow Empty Shadow] skills. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Trampling Shadow Trampling] creates a large 13 by 13 AoE around you which unhide hidden enemies and snare them for a short duration, while [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Empty_Shadow Empty Shadow] nullify reflect ability of a target and may cause target’s skills to fail (untested). Lastly, Kagerou also receive a very unique buff skill, called [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Warrior Shadow Warrior], which allows them to give Double Attack buff to a target. Although this may be quite useful for auto attacking classes, you may find that there are very few classes (including Kagerous themselves) which prefer auto-attack to skill spamming in renewal, limiting the usefulness of this skill.

On the other hand, Oboro is relatively better at PVM since they have one of the best, yet complicated to use, buff which is the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] which give significant amount of ATK/MATK bonus based on the target's current HP and SP. However, it should be noted that [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] can also reduce target’s ATK/MATK if used improperly (please refer to the Tips and Tricks section on how to use this skill effectively). Oboro’s two other skills are a bit mediocre due to their very specific requirements. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ominous_Moonlight Ominous Moonlight] skill allows you to put an inverse healing debuff on a target. Using this skill in tandem with Arch Bishop’s Highness Heal will make the target receive instant 12k+ damage (xD).  Oboro’s last skill, called [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Moonlight_Fantasy Moonlight Fantasy], randomly restores or drains target HP/SP based on their current HP and SP. Since you can’t really tell the current HP of your enemies, this skill is very situational.

In conclusion, both Kagerou and Oboro have their own unique set of skills that may interest you. If you enjoy PVM more compared to PVP content like I do, I will recommend choosing Oboro for the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] buff. Your party, especially the physical attackers, will love you for this skills and they will even change their max HP just to get this buff. On the other hand, if you like to do PVP more than PVM, Kagerou may have more useful skills at your disposal. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Trampling Shadow Trampling] is a good skill to have especially considering that hiding or cloaking is very common in PVP situation. Furthermore, you can use [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Empty_Shadow Empty Shadow] to cripple your enemies and making sure that they won’t reflect your damage back.

== Notable Skills for All Builds==
These skills are useful most of the time regardless of your build. 

=== Ninja Skills ===
[[File: Cicada_Skin_Shed.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed]
This is a Ninja’s trademark skill that you should use all the time. This skill will allow you to block 1-3 physical hits (including skills) and dodge 7 cells backwards in the process. It should be noted that flee, perfect dodge, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Safety_Wall Safety Wall], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kyrie_Eleison Kyrie Eleison] take priority over this skill. Dodging the hit/skill through those other means will not activate your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed]. Because of this, I highly recommend keeping decent amount of flee and perfect dodge to increase your survivability.

[[File: Mirror_Image.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image]
This is another great survival skill to have. Under [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image] buff, you will be able to dodge 1-5 physical hits/ skills. One {{item |id=7524  &lt;nowiki>Shadow Orb&lt;/nowiki>}} is consumed together with your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Aura Ninja Aura] buff every time you cast this spell. It should also be noted that both [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image] will be triggered simultaneously if you have both skills active. Despite of this rather glaring drawback, I find it to be very useful in an MVP party where you can stand still and spam your offensive skills. On other occasions, I will just recommend using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed].

[[File: Ninja_Aura.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Aura Ninja Aura]
Extra INT and STR will always be useful no matter what. Furthermore, it is also required to use [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke]. Using any of those skills will consume your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Aura Ninja Aura] buff.

[[File: Ninja_Mastery.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Mastery Ninja Mastery]
Due to your limited SP pool, regenerating SP is always nice. This skill is also a prerequisite for other useful Ninja Skills.

[[File: Shadow_Leap.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Leap Shadow Leap]
A good mobility skill which can be used in conjunction with Haze Slasher or Kagerou’s/Oboro’s [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Hiding Shadow Hiding].

[[File: Watery_Evasion.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Watery_Evasion Watery Evasion] [Optional]
This skill create an AoE which will slow enemies’ movement speed and reduce their AGI for a duration, which is very nice if you are dealing with mobs. Furthermore it will also allow [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Water_Ball Water Ball] or [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Aqua_Benedicta Aqua Benedicta] to be casted. Despite its strong points, due to the large amount of prerequisites, I only recommend to invest in this skill only if you have spare skill points.

[[File: Flip_Tatami.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flip_Tatami Flip Tatami] [Highly Situational]
This skill create a cross-like AoE which will knockback enemies and create a zone that blocks ranged physical damage for 3 seconds. Due to the 3 seconds after-cast delay, its usefulness is very minimal. However, it may be good enough to replace a [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pneuma Pneuma] if so desperately needed. You will need to invest 1 point in it to learn other useful skills.

=== Kagerou/Oboro Skills ===

[[File: Charm-Earth.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Earth Charm Earth] 
Use this to increase your weapon attack. At lvl 10 you can endow your weapon with Earth Element.

[[File: Charm-Fire.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Fire Charm Fire] 
Use this to boost your Fire Spells. At lvl 10 you can endow your weapon with Fire Element.

[[File: Charm-Ice.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Ice Charm Ice] 
Use this to boost your Ice/Water Spell. At lvl 10 you can endow your weapon with Water Element.

[[File: Charm-Wind.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Wind Charm Wind] 
Use this to boost your Wind Spell. At lvl 10 you can endow your weapon with Wind Element.

[[File: Illusion-Shadow.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Illusion-Shadow Illusion Shadow] 
It is very useful to redirect monster aggression from yourself. At max level, it can even tank several MVP hits.

[[File: Pure_Soul.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul] 
This is another good survivability skill to have as Kagerou/Oboro. With this skill, I rarely need to bring any HP or SP recovery items on me. While you can’t move during the active effect, you can still use all of your skills which include your mobility skills such as [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Hiding Shadow Hiding] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Leap Shadow Leap]. Furthermore, you can also use this skill to restore HP/SP even when you are overweight.

[[File: Shadow_Hiding.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Hiding Shadow Hiding] 
This skill allows you to use any Ninja’s skills that require hiding effect. Use this in conjunction with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Leap Shadow Leap] to move across the battlefield.

[[File: 16th_Night.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night] 
This is the best Kagerou’s/Oboro’s skill in my opinion and it is honestly the sole reason why Magic Kagerou and Oboro are viable at all. This skill reduce your fixed cast time by 100% and variable cast time by 50%. However, it should be noted that the Variable Cast Time reduction stack multiplicatively (not additively), which means that you will only reduce your variable cast time to 25% if you combine this skill with 50% reduction from your gears. Having this skill at level 3 is sufficient enough since you will be able to cast it just as your buff runs out.

[[File: Makibishi.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Makibishi Makibishi] [Optional] 
Think of it as an AoE Ankle Snare with low damage and shorter snare duration. This skill requires many skill points investment if you are going with Magic Build. Because of this reason and the short snare duration, I only find this skill to be optional.

[[File: Release_Ninja_Spell.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Release_Ninja_Spell Release Ninja Spell] [Optional] 
If you keep track of your charms’ duration, this skill is pretty nice to have. You can consume all your charms to deal high elemental damage to a target.

[[File: Cast_Ninja_Spell.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cast_Ninja_Spell Cast Ninja Spell] [Optional-PVP] 
Consume all your charms to create a 5x5 AoE on the ground which inflict various status ailments (depends on the charms consumed) to enemies. You can use this to buff your weapon ATK as well if you are wearing weapon with the same element.

[[File: Distorted_Crescent.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] [Oboro’s Exclusive Skill] 
This is one of the best damage buff in the game if casted properly. The MATK bonus will be very useful for Magic Oboro while ATK bonus will be useful for Throwing and KS/RT Oboro. Please refer to the Tips and Tricks Section below.

[[File: Empty_Shadow.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Empty_Shadow Empty Shadow] [Kagerou’s Exclusive Skill- PVP] 
This skill is possibly the reason why you choose Kagerou. It remove reflect effect from target. Furthermore, target under the effect of this debuff may have their skills fail to activate. Personally, I have never tried this skill yet since I’m not really a PVP enthusiast and I only have an Oboro at the moment. However, I’m very interested in testing this skill in the near future.

[[File: Shadow_Trampling.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Trampling Shadow Trampling] [Optional-PVP] 
THis is another reason to choose Kagerou over Oboro. It is a very nice skill to reveal hidden enemies around you in PVP.

== Throwing Builds ==
Among the three different builds, I personally think that this is the most flexible build and has the easiest time to level and farm with. It is relatively easy to gear up a Throwing Kagerou/Oboro and achieve a high damage output, comparable to other regular 3rd job classes. This is mainly due to the ease of access to {{item |id=13313  &lt;nowiki>Huuma Swirling Petal [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}, which is the best weapon for Kagerou/Oboro AoE skill [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal]. Furthermore, with Kagerou’s/Oboro’s elemental charm, you can easily endow your weapon with wind, fire, water, or earth element. You can also buy elemental kunais from vendor to use in conjunction with your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Splash Kunai Splash] skills.

=== Stats Allocations ===
Since stats allocations will depend significantly on your equipment, I will only list the stats point in the order of importance for each build. Try to get the necessary breakpoints for your equipments (90 pure stats for {{item |id=2576  &lt;nowiki>Heroic Backpack [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}, 120 pure DEX for {{item |id=22004  Temporal DEX Boots}}, 110 pure STR if you are using {{item |id=2923  Str Glove [1]}}).

'''DEX''': DEX is used as skill modifier for most of your skills. Furthermore, it also reduce your variable cast time. Together with STR, these two are your most vital stats.

'''STR''': It is another equally important stats since most of your skill depends on STR for their damage formula.

'''AGI''': AGI is used as a skill modifier together with DEX for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal] skill. Furthermore, this will increase your Flee and also ASPD, which is crucial if you are going with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Splash Kunai Splash] build.

'''VIT''': High VIT means high HP pool. Since you have many dodging skills such as [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul], it is of less importance compared to AGI. A good Kagerou/Oboro will rarely get hit by any physical attack.

'''LUK''': Luk will provide small increase in ATK, HIT, FLEE, and Perfect Dodge.

'''INT''': You will rarely need INT since you can regenerate your SP with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul]. Furthermore, you can get significant amount of MDEF by enchanting your Ninja Equipment through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Gear_Enchants Ninja Gear Enchants]

=== Notable Skills ===
[[File: Dagger_Throwing_Practice.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dagger_Throwing_Practice Dagger Throwing Practice]
This skill give a slight boost to your Throwing Skills. Furthermore, it is also necessary to have this skill at lv 10 to deal the full damage with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw].

[[File: Throw_Kunai.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai]
Since [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai] is used as prerequisites for most of Kagerou's/Oboro's Throwing skills, you will most likely have this skill at max level already. With relatively short cast delay of 1 second, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai] is quite reliable if you are fighting a single enemy.

[[File: Kunai_Explosion.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Explosion Kunai Explosion]
This is a nice AoE physical skill that you have as a Kagerou/Oboro although it may be rather tricky to use due to its relatively small AoE (3x3), short cast range, and rather long cast time. Use this when Swirling Petal is on cooldown to increase your overall damage output. It should be noted that this skill relies heavily on your base and job level as its damage modifier, making it less useful on lower level.

[[File: Swirling_Petal.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal]
This skill enables Throwing Kagerou/Oboro to farm quite nicely. It hits very hard and has a decent AoE damage and size. This will be your primary skill as a Throwing Kagerou/Oboro. I highly recommend getting it to level 5 as soon as possible.

[[File: Kunai_Splash.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Splash Kunai Splash] [Optional- Alternative AoE Farming]
This is another useful AoE skill to have, especially considering that it has a negligible after-cast delay. However, due to the horrendous weight of Kunais in the game, you will have a hard time carrying enough of them to use this skill effectively. Each cast will consume 8 kunais to damage enemies in 11x11 cells at level 5. I strongly recommend using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal] instead of this for levelling purposes, mainly due to the high cost associated with gears and consumables. At this moment, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Splash Kunai Splash] is considered '''Melee Attack''' and it only gets bonus damage from your stats (STR,DEX,LUK), %ATK modifier from gears, and racial ATK modifier from your main-hand weapon.

[[File: Rapid_Throw.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw] [Optional- PVP]
This skill deal 50k-100k defense-piercing damage to enemies within 5x5 cells at level 5. While you can easily kill other players (even including the fully geared ones) with this skill, it comes with a great cost of 100k Zenny. If you are interested in PVP, you should definitely get this skill; however, you should definitely prepare your heart to see your 100k Zenny gone within 1 mouse click.

=== Equipments ===
==== Headgears ====
* {{item |id=5359  &lt;nowiki>Airship Captain's Hat [1] (Upper)&lt;/nowiki>}}: The +7% ranged attack bonus easily makes this hat to be the best Upper Headgear that you can wear.
* {{item |id=5208  &lt;nowiki>Rideword Hat [1] (Upper)&lt;/nowiki>}}: Very nice alternative to {{item |id=5359  &lt;nowiki>Airship Captain's Hat [1] (Upper)&lt;/nowiki>}} which will allow you to restore HP and SP on a small chance. If you manage to refine it to +9, the activation chance will be higher. This headgear can be crafted through [[Custom Headgear Quests]]quest.
* {{item |id=18550  &lt;nowiki>Asgard Blessing [1] (Upper)&lt;/nowiki>}}: An overall decent headgear for any class which give +2 to all stats and +5% resistance to all elements.
* Any Slotted Mid Headgear: You will need this to put your {{item |id=4468  &lt;nowiki>Dark Pinguicula Card&lt;/nowiki>}}.
* {{item |id=5389  &lt;nowiki>Angel Spirit (Mid)&lt;/nowiki>}}: A nice Mid Headgear which give you 2% ATK bonus, 2% Matk bonus and +2 STR.
* {{item |id=5325  &lt;nowiki>Robo Eye (Mid)&lt;/nowiki>}}: An overall decent Mid Headgear with 2% ATK bonus, 2% Matk bonus and +1 DEX.

* {{item |id=5305  &lt;nowiki>Pirate Dagger (Lower)&lt;/nowiki>}}: Same bonus as Gangster Scarf. I see no reason to choose this over the relatively cheaper {{item |id=5361  &lt;nowiki>Gangster Scarf (Lower)&lt;/nowiki>}}.
* Headgear Card
** {{item |id=4468  &lt;nowiki>Dark Pinguicula Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: Extra 10 ATK bonus will always be desirable under all situations.
** Any cards which provides resistance to status ailments

==== Main-Hand Weapon ====
* {{item |id=13313  &lt;nowiki>Huuma Swirling Petal [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is the best weapon for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal] with 150 ATK and +20% damage from [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal]. Furthermore, you can also do a decent damage with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Explosion Kunai Explosion] if it is combined with 2 {{item |id=4094  &lt;nowiki>Archer Skeleton Card&lt;/nowiki>}}. The only drawback  is that it is only a level 3 weapon.
* {{item |id=13090  &lt;nowiki>Faceworm Queen Leg [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A level 4 Dagger with 180 ATK and two card slots. If, for some reason, you dislike [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal] and prefer to get as much damage as possible with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Explosion Kunai Explosion] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai] instead, this is most likely be the best main-hand weapon that you can get.
* {{item |id=1237  &lt;nowiki>Grimtooth&lt;/nowiki>}} [{{item |id=4835  &lt;nowiki>EA 4&lt;/nowiki>}}/{{item |id=4835  &lt;nowiki>EA 4&lt;/nowiki>}}]: An alternative weapon to {{item |id=13090  &lt;nowiki>Faceworm Queen Leg [2]&lt;/nowiki>}} which has the same 180 ATK value. Expert Archer enchant should be used to compensate for the lack of card slot.
* Weapon Card
** {{item |id=4094  &lt;nowiki>Archer Skeleton Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: The +10% ranged attack bonus easily makes this the best weapon card for general purposes
** ATK boosting Card

==== Off-Hand Weapon (for Throw Kunai and Kunai Explosion)====
* {{item |id=1208  &lt;nowiki>Main Gauche [4]&lt;/nowiki>}}: Even though {{item |id=1208  &lt;nowiki>Main Gauche [4]&lt;/nowiki>}} looks a bit lacklustre, it is one of the best off-hand weapon due to its 4 card slots which allows you to socket it with all of your racial damage boosting cards.
* Weapon Card
** {{item |id=4094  &lt;nowiki>Archer Skeleton Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: A very solid weapon card that you can get for any ranged physical attackers. Enough said.
** Racial Bonus Card

==== Armor ====
* {{item |id=15055  &lt;nowiki>Tenebris Latitantes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is a really good armor which is exclusive to Kagerou/Oboro/Ninja class. It will allow you to auto-cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Illusion-Shadow Illusion Shadow] with a low chance. Please refer to Tips and Tricks section on how to obtain and enchant this equipment.
* {{item |id=15053  &lt;nowiki>Special Ninja Suit&lt;/nowiki>}}: A decent and relatively cheap armor that you can use while trying to get {{item |id=15055  &lt;nowiki>Tenebris Latitantes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}. This armor will give additional AGI based on refine level.
* {{item |id=2319  &lt;nowiki>Glittering Jacket [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A standard armor with a card slot. This armor can also be enchanted for extra Stats point through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Hidden_Enchant Hidden Enchant].

** Any Elemental Card
** Any Status Ailments Resistance Card

==== Garment ====
* {{item |id=2576  &lt;nowiki>Heroic Backpack [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A decent garment all-around. Just make sure to refine it to at least +7 and get the stats prerequisites for the bonuses.
* [[Faceworm Skins]]: Another solid garment. It is a more specialized option compared to {{item |id=2576  &lt;nowiki>Heroic Backpack [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}
* Garment Card
** {{item |id=4593  &lt;nowiki>Menblatt Card&lt;/nowiki>}}:This card will give you +1% ranged attack bonus for every 10 pure DEX. More ranged attack bonus means more damage for all three of your primary damage skills: [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Explosion Kunai Explosion], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Kunai_Splash Kunai Splash]. 
** {{item |id=4133  &lt;nowiki>Raydric Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: You can never go wrong with {{item |id=4133  &lt;nowiki>Raydric Card&lt;/nowiki>}}. Its 20% Neutral resistance will give you more survivability whenever you forget to renew your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed] buff in time.

==== Footgear ====
* {{item |id=22008  &lt;nowiki>Temporal Dex Boots [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} [{{item |id=4835  &lt;nowiki>EA4&lt;/nowiki>}}]: This is most likely be the best boots for Throwing build due to its extra %ranged attack bonus. Try to get this as soon as you can. 
* {{item |id=22036  &lt;nowiki>Hero Silverleather Boots [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A decent alternative to get while saving up for your {{item |id=22008  &lt;nowiki>Temporal Dex Boots [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}. I don't recommend trying to over-refine it to get the secondary bonus. It's most likely better to use your Zenny and Enriched Elunium somewhere else.
* {{item |id=22014  &lt;nowiki>Enhanced Variant Shoes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A solid all-around shoes which give you +12% MaxHP and MaxSP. Furthermore, it also come with a card slot.
* {{item |id=2408  &lt;nowiki>Shackles&lt;/nowiki>}}: You can use this in combination with {{item |id=2655  &lt;nowiki>Bloodied Shackle Ball&lt;/nowiki>}} for +50 ATK.
* Footgear Card
** {{item |id=4160  &lt;nowiki>Firelock Soldier Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is the best footgear card for general purposes if you manage to have a +9 footgear. It will give +10% MaxHP, +10% MaxSP, and +2 STR
** {{item |id=4378  &lt;nowiki>Gold Acidus Card&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4107  &lt;nowiki>Verit Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: They have slightly weaker effect compared to {{item |id=4160  &lt;nowiki>Firelock Soldier Card&lt;/nowiki>}} with only 8% MaxHP and 8% MaxSP; however, they are acceptable for most cases. 
** {{item |id=4381  &lt;nowiki>Green Ferus Card&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4097  &lt;nowiki>Matyr Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: These two will give +10% MaxHP and +1 to a certain stat

==== Accessories ====
* {{item |id=2910  &lt;nowiki>Bakonawa Agimat Tattoo&lt;/nowiki>}}: This accessories give +7% attack damage to all monster sizes and +10% ASPD. While the % attack damage bonus is very tempting for Throwing Kagerou/Oboro, it is relatively hard and tedious to get this accessories. Please refer to this [[Pintados Festival]] guide in the wiki.
* {{item |id=2923  &lt;nowiki>Str Glove [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: Since you will most likely have high STR for this build, I strongly recommend using this glove as it give you ATK+1 for every 10 pure STR and ATK+1% when STR is 110 and higher.
* {{item |id=2949  &lt;nowiki>Silversmith Bracelet [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: It is a good all-around accessories which give +1 to all stats, 3 MDEF, and access to LV5 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Spell_Breaker Spell Breaker].
* {{item |id=2721  &lt;nowiki>Medal of Honor (Thief)&lt;/nowiki>}} combo with {{item |id=2772  &lt;nowiki>Glorious Ring&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=2773  &lt;nowiki>Glorious Popularized Ring&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is a very nice combo that you can get from Battlegrounds. It will give you bonus damage and other nice bonuses.
* {{item |id=2655  &lt;nowiki>Bloodied Shackle Ball&lt;/nowiki>}}: Using this accessory in combination with {{item |id=2408  &lt;nowiki>Shackles&lt;/nowiki>}} will give you +50 ATK.
* {{item |id=2898  &lt;nowiki>Black Rosary [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: Since you can dodge most physical attacks with your skills, you will most likely need to worry solely on magic attack in PVM. With +15 MDEF, {{item |id=2898  &lt;nowiki>Black Rosary [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} is a really good defensive option.
* Accessories Card
** {{item |id=4508  &lt;nowiki>Gold Scaraba Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: More ATK means more damage on all of your physical skills. The +20 ATK bonus definitely deserve its relatively high price.
** {{item |id=4040  &lt;nowiki>Creamy Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: I personally like to have at least 1 {{item |id=4040  &lt;nowiki>Creamy Card&lt;/nowiki>}} on most of my farming characters. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Teleport Teleport] skill is always handy when you are farming. Furthermore, you will never run out of SP with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul]
** {{item |id=4064  &lt;nowiki>Zerom Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: Since DEX is used on most of your skills as a damage modifier, the +3 DEX bonus from this card can be useful
** {{item |id=4079  &lt;nowiki>Mantis Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: This card give you +3 STR which can boost your damage slightly. You can use this while saving up for {{item |id=4508  &lt;nowiki>Gold Scaraba Card&lt;/nowiki>}}.

== Magic Builds ==
[http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night] skill allows Kagerou and Oboro to cast their spell instantly if they manage to get 100% Variable Cast Time reduction. Because of this reason, it is possible to spam your 0 cast delay spells ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Freezing_Spear Freezing Spear], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First Wind]) as fast as what your ASPD allows you to. Furthermore you can also utilize monsters’ elemental weaknesses and use your charms to boost your magic damage even further. While this build can easily surpass Throwing build in damage output, it is relatively expensive to make a Magic Kagerou/Oboro. You will also find yourself to be a bit useless when fighting monsters or MVPs with Shadow or Holy element. 

Investing in a magic Kagerou/ Oboro can cost a fortune. With the addition of Airship's Assault and Devil's Tower instances, getting 100% Variable Cast Time reduction in NovaRO is currently achievable with gears only. 


=== Stats ===
'''INT''': This will be your primary stats as it increase your damage and reduce your cast time. Try to get it as high as possible or at least to a breakpoint for your {{item |id=22009  Temporal Int Boots [1]}}.

'''DEX''': DEX is mostly used to reduce your cast time. The magic number that you should aim for instant cast is 530(which should equal to 2*DEX +INT) after foods and buffs. If you can get 100% Variable Cast Time reduction from your gears only, you can leave DEX at 1 and put your points somewhere else

'''AGI''': Similar to Throwing build, this is an important stats to have for your survivability. Furthermore, since most of your damage spells will have 0 after-cast delay, ASPD will be a huge factor in determining how fast you can spam them.

'''VIT''': Similar to Throwing Build, high VIT means high HP pool. Since you have many dodging skills such as [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul], it is of less importance compared to AGI. A good Kagerou/Oboro will rarely get hit by any physical attack.

'''LUK''': Provide small increase in MATK, HIT, FLEE, and Perfect Dodge. They are all pretty nice and you should invest in LUK if you have some spare points.

'''STR''': For Magic Kagerou/Oboro, STR is not really required since you can easily restore your HP and SP using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul] even if you are above 50% weight limit.

=== Notable Skills ===
[[File: Flaming_Petals.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals]
This will be your go-to spell most of the time. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals] has 0 after-cast delay and has an insane scaling with your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Fire Charm Fire]. Because of these reasons, you will be very deadly against enemies who are weak to fire element.

[[File: Freezing_Spear.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Freezing_Spear Freezing Spear]
This is the second 0 after-cast delay spell that you have access to. While it scales worse compared to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals] with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Ice Charm Ice], it will still hits really hard against enemies who are weak to Water.

[[File: First_Wind.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First WInd]
As the third spell which has negligible after-cast delay, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First Wind] should be used when you are facing enemies who are weak to Lightning element. This spell also has a decent AoE which allows you to quickly dispose of your enemies in a line. Each cast will require 1 {{item |id=7523   Wind Stone}}. Similar to the other two spells mentioned, you can use [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Wind Charm Wind] to boost its damage.

[[File: Blaze_Shield.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Blaze_Shield Blaze Shield]
While Blaze Shield won’t deal massive amount of damage, it is your best way to activate your {{item |id=4412  Isilla Card}} Effect. Please refer to Tips and Tricks Section. Each cast will require 1 {{item |id=7521   Flame Stone}}

[[File: Exploding_Dragon.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Exploding_Dragon Exploding Dragon] [Optional]
This is a nice AoE Fire Spell which you can use when you are levelling. While Exploding dragons scales quite well with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Fire Charm Fire], the 3 seconds cast delay is somewhat unfortunate. Each cast will require 1 {{item |id=7521   Flame Stone}}

[[File: Snow_Flake_Draft.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Snow_Flake_Draft Snow Flake Draft] [Optional]
This AoE Water Spell can leave your enemies frozen which may be useful in some situation. Each cast will require 1 {{item |id=7522   Ice Stone}}

[[File: Wind_Blade.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Wind_Blade Wind Blade] [Optional]
This is your first Wind Elemental spell that you can learn. As a single target spell, this is quite decent for levelling purposes since you don’t need to spend any {{item |id=7523   Wind Stone}} to cast it. Even though [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Wind_Blade Wind Blade] scales much nicer with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Wind Charm Wind] compared to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First Wind], there is a cast delay on this spell, making it less useful compared to http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Freezing_Spear Freezing Spear], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First Wind]

[[File: Lightning_Jolt.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Lightning_Jolt Lightning Jolt] [Optional]
[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Lightning_Jolt Lightning Jolt] has a much bigger AoE compared to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First Wind]; however, it has a relatively lower base damage. This spell also has 0 after-cast delay

=== Equipments ===
==== Headgears ====
* {{item |id=5564  &lt;nowiki>Crown of Deceit [1] (Upper, Middle)&lt;/nowiki>}}: This item will give you bonus to INT, Dex, %MATK, and Variable Cast Time Reduction, especially if refined to +7 and higher.
* {{item |id=18539  &lt;nowiki>Skull Cap [1] (Upper)&lt;/nowiki>}}: This item will give you a decent amount of %MATK bonus, especially if refined to +7 and higher.
* {{item |id=18611  &lt;nowiki>Black Frame Glasses [1] (Mid)&lt;/nowiki>}}:This slotted headgear give +1 INT, +2 MDEF, and a card slot.
* Any slotted Mid Headgear: You can replace {{item |id=18611  &lt;nowiki>Black Frame Glasses [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} with any Mid Headgear. While the bonuses from {{item |id=18611  &lt;nowiki>Black Frame Glasses [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} are definitely desirable, the card slot is what you are really aiming for.
* {{item |id=5463  &lt;nowiki>Rainbow Scarf (Lower)&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is a very good Lower Headgear which gives you +1 INT, +1% MATK, and MDEF +2.
* {{item |id=5362  &lt;nowiki>Ninja Scroll(Lower)&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is a slightly weaker version of {{item |id=5463  &lt;nowiki>Rainbow Scarf (Lower)&lt;/nowiki>}} with only +1% MATK. 
* Headgear Card
** {{item |id=4366  &lt;nowiki>Kathryne Keyron Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: If you have a highly refined headgear, the Variable Cast Time Reduction from this card can be really beneficial.
** {{item |id=4412  &lt;nowiki>Isilla Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: Using two {{item |id=4412  &lt;nowiki>Isilla Card&lt;/nowiki>}} will double your activation chance. Furthermore, the effect can stack with one another making your cast time negligible when you pull this off. Isilla's card activation will be really handy if you can't get 100% Variable Cast Time Reduction purely from gears yet.
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}: Compared to the other essences, Int3 and Vit3 are highly desirable due to their great secondary effects. Due to the rarity of +MATK or +MDEF effects in cards, these two essences are recommended for any slots.
** Any Status Ailments Resistance Card

==== Weapon ====
* {{item |id=1231   Bazerald}} [{{item |id=4812   Spell4}},{{item |id=4812   Spell4}}]: With 105 MATK and +5 INT bonus, this lv.4 weapon is quite decent. However, its best selling point comes from its [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Malangdo_Enchants Malangdo Enchants] capability. The MATK and Variable Cast Time reduction bonus from [{{item |id=4812   Spell4}},{{item |id=4812   Spell4}}] easily make this the best main-hand weapon for Magic Kagerou/Oboro. 
* {{item |id=13094   &lt;nowiki>Evil Slayer Stabber Dagger [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} [{{item |id=4812   &lt;nowiki>Spell4+&lt;/nowiki>}},{{item |id=4812   &lt;nowiki>Spell4+&lt;/nowiki>}},{{item |id=4812   &lt;nowiki>Spell4+&lt;/nowiki>}} ]: With the possibility of getting more than 20% variable cast time reduction, this dagger has the potential to be your best off-hand weapon.
* {{item |id=13090  &lt;nowiki>Faceworm Queen Leg [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A level 4 Dagger with 120 MATK, +3 INT,  and two card slots. This is most likely be your best alternative to a fully enchanted {{item |id=1231   Bazerald}}.
* {{item |id=13078  &lt;nowiki>Mikatsuki [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A much cheaper alternative compared to an enchanted {{item |id=1231   Bazerald}} and {{item |id=13090  &lt;nowiki>Faceworm Queen Leg [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}. This lv 4 Ninja-exclusive Dagger has 120 MATK, 5% Variable Cast Time Reduction, and 5% SP consumption reduction. Please refer to Tips and Tricks on how to obtain and enchant this weapon.
* {{item |id=1208  &lt;nowiki>Main Gauche [4] (Off-Hand)&lt;/nowiki>}}: Even though {{item |id=1208  &lt;nowiki>Main Gauche [4]&lt;/nowiki>}} looks a bit lacklustre, it is one of the best off-hand weapon due to its 4 card slots which allows you to socket it with all of your racial magic damage boosting cards.
* Weapon Card
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}
** Any Racial Magic Damage Bonus Card
** Any Status Ailments (from Magic Damage) Inflicting Card

==== Shield ====
While dual-wielding a dagger may be a better offensive option, you can also use an armguard or a shield to increase your survivability. I'm suggesting the following gears if you prefer to use shield.

* {{item |id=2173  &lt;nowiki>Crescent Armguard [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: This Ninja-exclusive shield can be enchanted to get additional stats,DEF,or MDEF bonus. Please refer to Tips and Tricks section on how to obtain and enchant this equipment. 
* {{item |id=2115  &lt;nowiki>Valkyrja's Shield [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is my personal go-to shield for Kagerou/Oboro. As I've mentioned previously, you will most likely need to care only about magical damage in PVM due to your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image] skills. The +20% resistance bonus to Fire, Water, Shadow, and Undead element is definitely a welcome addition to your already stellar defensive capabilities.
* Shield Card
** {{item |id=4413  &lt;nowiki>Hodremlin Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: This card reduce damage from monsters of all sizes by 15% and give you a low chance to increase Perfect Dodge by 30. This is definitely a solid all-around defensive card, which is only slightly inferior to the famous {{item |id=4609  &lt;nowiki>Khalitzburg Knightage Card&lt;/nowiki>}}.
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}
** Any Elemental Resist Card
** Any Racial Resist Card

==== Armor ====
* {{item |id=15055  &lt;nowiki>Tenebris Latitantes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is a really good armor which is exclusive to Kagerou/Oboro/Ninja class. It will allow you to auto-cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Illusion-Shadow Illusion Shadow] with a low chance. Please refer to Tips and Tricks section on how to obtain and enchant this equipment.
* {{item |id=15053  &lt;nowiki>Special Ninja Suit&lt;/nowiki>}}: A decent and relatively cheap armor that you can use while trying to get {{item |id=15055  &lt;nowiki>Tenebris Latitantes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}. This armor will give additional AGI based on refine level.
* {{item |id=2319  &lt;nowiki>Glittering Jacket [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A standard armor with a card slot. This armor can also be enchanted for extra Stats point through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Hidden_Enchant Hidden Enchant].
* Armor Card
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}
** Any Elemental Card
** Any Status Ailments Resistance Card
** Any Status Ailments Inflicting Card

==== Garment ====
* {{item |id=20744  &lt;nowiki>Ferlock's Cloak [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is the best in slot for the Magic Build due to the possibility of getting 30% or 35% Variable Cast Time Reduction at +9 or +12 refinement level respectively. You should always try to refine this garment to +9; otherwise, {{item |id=20743  &lt;nowiki>Cloak of Airship [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} is a better alternative.
* {{item |id=20743  &lt;nowiki>Cloak of Airship [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A really good garment which has the same bonus as a +7 {{item |id=20744  &lt;nowiki>Ferlock's Cloak [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}.
* {{item |id=2576  &lt;nowiki>Heroic Backpack [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A decent garment all-around. Just make sure to refine it to at least +7 and get the stats prerequisites for the bonuses.
* [[Faceworm Skins]]: Another solid garment. It is a more specialized option compared to {{item |id=2576  &lt;nowiki>Heroic Backpack [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}
* Garment Card
** {{item |id=4593  &lt;nowiki>Antique Book Card&lt;/nowiki>}}:This card will give you +5 MATK bonus for every 10 pure INT. This is the best offensive card for garment slot.
** {{item |id=4133  &lt;nowiki>Raydric Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: You can never go wrong with {{item |id=4133  &lt;nowiki>Raydric Card&lt;/nowiki>}}. Its 20% Neutral resistance will give you more survivability whenever you forget to renew your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed] buff in time.
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}

==== Footgear ====
* {{item |id=22009  Temporal Int Boots [1]}} [{{item |id=4830   Spell9}}]: This enchanted Temporal Boots will give you a massive +100 MATK (for +4 refinement level) and 10% Variable Cast Time Reduction if you have at least 120 Pure Int.
* {{item |id=22035   Hero Nependess Shoes [1]}}: The Variable Cast Time reduction bonus makes this footgear a decent alternative to get while saving up for your {{item |id=22009  Temporal Int Boots [1]}}. I don't recommend trying to over-refine it to get the secondary bonus. It's most likely better to use your Zenny and Enriched Elunium somewhere else.
* {{item |id=22014  &lt;nowiki>Enhanced Variant Shoes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: A solid all-around shoes which give you +12% MaxHP and MaxSP. Furthermore, it also come with a card slot.
* Footgear Card
** {{item |id=4160  &lt;nowiki>Firelock Soldier Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is the best footgear card for general purposes if you manage to have a +9 footgear. It will give +10% MaxHP, +10% MaxSP, and +2 STR
** {{item |id=4378  &lt;nowiki>Gold Acidus Card&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4107  &lt;nowiki>Verit Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: They have slightly weaker effect compared to {{item |id=4160  &lt;nowiki>Firelock Soldier Card&lt;/nowiki>}} with only 8% MaxHP and 8% MaxSP; however, they are acceptable for most cases. 
** {{item |id=4381  &lt;nowiki>Green Ferus Card&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4097  &lt;nowiki>Matyr Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: These two will give +10% MaxHP and +1 to a certain stat
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}

==== Accessories ====
* {{item |id=2924  &lt;nowiki>Int Glove [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: Since you will most likely have high INT for this build, I strongly recommend using this glove as it give you MATK+1 for every 10 pure INT and MATK+1% when STR is 110 and higher.
* {{item |id=2907  &lt;nowiki>Buwaya Agimat Tattoo&lt;/nowiki>}}: This accessories give +7% MATK and +7% Fixed Cast Time reduction. While the %MATK bonus is always nice to have, you don't really need any Fixed Cast Time reduction because of your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night] skill. Please refer to this [[Pintados Festival]] guide in the wiki.
* {{item |id=2949  &lt;nowiki>Silversmith Bracelet [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: It is a good all-around accessories which give +1 to all stats, 3 MDEF, and access to LV5 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Spell_Breaker Spell Breaker].
* {{item |id=2721  &lt;nowiki>Medal of Honor (Thief)&lt;/nowiki>}} combo with {{item |id=2772  &lt;nowiki>Glorious Ring&lt;/nowiki>}}: This is a very nice combo that you can get from Battlegrounds. It will give you bonus %MATK and also a 3% Variable Cast Time Reduction
* {{item |id=2898  &lt;nowiki>Black Rosary [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}: Since you can dodge most physical attacks with your skills, you will most likely need to worry solely on magic attack in PVM. With +15 MDEF, {{item |id=2898  &lt;nowiki>Black Rosary [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} is a really good defensive option.
* Accessories Card
** {{item |id=4505  &lt;nowiki>Scaraba Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: The +20 MATK bonus means more damage on all of your spells, which is highly desirable. 
** {{item |id=4040  &lt;nowiki>Creamy Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: I personally like to have at least 1 {{item |id=4040  &lt;nowiki>Creamy Card&lt;/nowiki>}} on most of my farming characters. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Teleport Teleport] skill is always handy when you are farming. Furthermore, you will never run out of SP with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul] even if you are overweight.
** {{item |id=4064  &lt;nowiki>Zerom Card&lt;/nowiki>}}: The +3 DEX bonus fromt his card is desirable, especially if you are trying to reach the 530 Instant Cast breakpoint.
** {{item |id=4913  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Intelligence3&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4919  &lt;nowiki>Darklord Essence Vitality3&lt;/nowiki>}}

== Killing Stroke/Rapid Throw Build ==
This is mainly a PVP build. The idea behind this build is to nuke your enemies with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke] in combination with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw] to quickly kill them. With decent equipments, you can easily deal 50k+ to a geared players with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke] in PVP. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw] can also deal significant defence-piercing damage to enemies in a small AoE. 

Overall, I think KS/RT Kagerou/Oboro has some potential in PVP. However, as a mainly PVM player, I find it tough to compete with others, most likely due to my own shortcomings or lack of knowledge in PVP meta-game. There are several PVP aspects which doesn’t help Kagerou/Oboro as well, especially on Battlegrounds and WoE. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Leap Shadow Leap] is useless in Battlegrounds as it just unhides you on the spot. One of the most commonly used skill in PVP, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Acid_Bomb Acid Bomb], bypasses your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image] protection. Last but not least, both of your means of killing the enemies are counted as physical ranged damage, meaning that a good [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Sura Sura], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Arch_Bishop Arch Bishop], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Sorcerer Sorcerer] can block your skills with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pneuma Pneuma] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Wall_of_fog Wall of Fog]. Magic Kagerou/Oboro is not really an option in pvp due to the telegraphic nature of the charms (e.g. with 10 floating fire charms, your enemy can just put on their fire armor and easily nullify your damage). For a more detailed guide on PVP aspect of Kagerou/Oboro, I highly recommend reading Nosher’s guide [http://novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/1095-unveiling-the-shadows-a-kagerouoboro-analysis/ Unveiling the Shadows - A Kagerou/Oboro analysis].

=== Stats ===
'''STR''': STR will be your primary stats as it will increase your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke] damage. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw] damage is purely from the amount of Zenny that you spent.

'''VIT''': In addition to the typical survivability value, your HP pool will be used as a skill modifier for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke]. I highly recommend prioritizing both STR and VIT for this build since you will most likely use [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke] as your primary means of dealing damage. 

'''DEX''': Together with LUK, it will increase the probability of hitting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw]. Furthermore it will also reduce your variable cast time slightly.

'''LUK''': As mentioned above, LUK will also increase your hit chance with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw]. I highly recommend getting roughly equal amount of Dex and LUK for this build since they both contribute equally to your hit chance. 

'''AGI''': This will help increase your flee rate. However, since this is primarily a PVP build, you can definitely ignore this stat.

'''INT''': This is another dump stats for this build. Since your primary damage skill is based on ATK, you will rarely need to allocate point in INT.

=== Notable Skills ===
[[File: Killing_Stroke.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke]

[[File: Rapid_Throw.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Rapid_Throw Rapid Throw]

=== Equipments ===
Instead of mentioning similar gear recommendations to what Nosher has excellently covered in his guide, I will once again recommend you to read his [http://novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/1095-unveiling-the-shadows-a-kagerouoboro-analysis/ Unveiling the Shadows - A Kagerou/Oboro analysis]. I'm not really a fan of PVP in renewal, especially considering that you have too few wiggle room outside of the standard WoE sets and other demi-human reduction gears and cards. The damage reduction from WoE sets is too essential to be replaced by other gears.

== Tips and Tricks ==
=== Obtaining Ninja Gears ===
==== Huuma Swirling Petal ====
You can get your best throwing weapon, {{item |id=13313  &lt;nowiki>Huuma Swirling Petal [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}, from both Incubus and Succubus in Geffenia. Since this location is also famous as one of the best Zenny farming location, I strongly recommend any Throwing Kagerou/Oboro to start farming here as soon as possible to get a highly refined {{item |id=13313  &lt;nowiki>Huuma Swirling Petal [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}. The notable loots here are {{item |id=522  &lt;nowiki>Mastela Fruit&lt;/nowiki>}}, {{item |id=526  &lt;nowiki>Royal Jelly&lt;/nowiki>}}, {{item |id=2613  &lt;nowiki>Diamond Ring&lt;/nowiki>}}, {{item |id=2610  &lt;nowiki>Gold Ring&lt;/nowiki>}} , {{item |id=4140  &lt;nowiki>Gold Ring&lt;/nowiki>}}, {{item |id=509  &lt;nowiki>White Herb&lt;/nowiki>}}, and {{item |id=4140  &lt;nowiki>Abysmal Knight Card&lt;/nowiki>}}. 
If you have a {{item |id=13304  &lt;nowiki>Huuma Calm Mind [2]&lt;/nowiki>}} and 100 {{item |id=7156  &lt;nowiki>Broken Shuriken&lt;/nowiki>}} with you, you can also exchange them through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Weapon_Quests Ninja Weapon Quest].

==== Mikatsuki ====
While a fully enchanted {{item |id=1231  &lt;nowiki>Bazerald&lt;/nowiki>}} can outclass a {{item |id=13078  &lt;nowiki>Mikatsuki [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}, you won’t need to spend significantly large amount of zenny to get it. As a weapon level 4 with 120 MATK, it is also comparable to a {{item |id=13090  &lt;nowiki>Faceworm Queen's Leg [2]&lt;/nowiki>}}, especially considering that you can enchant the third and fourth slot of your {{item |id=13078  &lt;nowiki>Mikatsuki [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}. I will suggest all Magic Kagerou/Oboro to use this lovely dagger as their starting weapons. 
You can get {{item |id=13078  &lt;nowiki>Mikatsuki [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} by exchanging 1 {{item |id=13015  &lt;nowiki>Hakujin [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} and 1 {{item |id=727  &lt;nowiki>Opal&lt;/nowiki>}} through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Weapon_Quests Ninja Weapon Quests].

==== Wolf Armguard, Crescent Armguard, Ninja Scale Armor, Tenebris Latitantes ====
All of these items can be obtained through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Equipment_Quests Ninja Equipment Quests]. The two armguards have relatively good effects which you may find useful for Throwing or Magic Build. {{item |id=15054  &lt;nowiki>Ninja Scale Armor [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} may be one of the better armor for [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Killing_Stroke Killing Stroke] due to its % maxHP bonus and a card slot even though it will be really tedious for you to farm the required MVP items to get it. Last but not least, you can also get the best all-around armor for Kagerou/Oboro {{item |id=15055  &lt;nowiki>Tenebris Latitantes [1]&lt;/nowiki>}} from this quest.

Most of the required items can be farmed from monsters or bought at the Ninja Guild. To get {{item |id=15056  &lt;nowiki>Special Ninja Suit [1]&lt;/nowiki>}}, you will need to [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Socket_Enchant Socket Enchant] your regular {{item |id=15053  &lt;nowiki>Special Ninja Suit&lt;/nowiki>}} by talking to Leablem. It should be noted that {{item |id=15053  &lt;nowiki>Special Ninja Suit&lt;/nowiki>}} is listed under A-Rank armor.

==== Ninja Gear Enchants ====
It is possible to enchant your Ninja gears through [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Ninja_Gear_Enchants Ninja Gear Enchants]. Each enchanting attempt cost 100k Zenny and each equipment can be enchanted twice. The enchantments that you can get are random; however, you can pay another 100k Zenny to reset either only your last enchantment or both of your enchantments.
I highly recommend enchanting for INT/DEX to improve your damage and cast time or MDEF to increase your overall survivability. With [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mirror_Image Mirror Image] at your disposal, you will only need to worry about magical attacks most of the time (it’s more complicated in PVP).

=== Using the Zero After-Cast Delay Spells ===
There are four spells with zero after-cast delays which you can learn: [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Freezing_Spear Freezing Spear], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/First_Wind First Wind], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Lightning_Jolt Lightning Jolt]. Among those four spells, you will typically only use the first three to cover your elemental spell repertoire due to their relatively superior base damage. By using the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night] and high variable cast rate reduction, you can spam these spells repeatedly as seen below.
{| class="wikitable"
|[[File: Flaming Petal_Scaled.gif|none|frame|Casting Flaming Petals Repeatedly]]
|[[File: Freezing Spear_Scaled.gif|none|frame|Casting Freezing Spear Repeatedly]]
|[[File: First Wind_Scaled.gif|none|frame|Casting First Wind Repeatedly]]
|}

=== Using Elemental Charms ===
You should use elemental charms to boost your damage or endow your weapon, regardless of your build. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Earth Charm-Earth] boost your weapon ATK, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Fire Charm-Fire] boost your Fire Spells, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Wind Charm-Wind] boost your Wind Spells, and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Charm-Ice Charm-Ice] boost your Ice or Water Damage. Each Spell is affected differently by their corresponding Charm. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Flaming_Petals Flaming Petals] with 10 Fire Charms will probably be your default spell as the 10 Charms effectively triple your damage.
[[File: AfterCharm.gif|none|thumb|Damage of Flaming Petals with 10 Active Fire Charms]]
Furthermore, having 10 of the same charms active on you will endow your weapon with that element. Because of this reason, as a Throwing Kagerou/Oboro, I usually only use 9 Earth Charms if I don’t want to endow my weapon with Earth Element.

=== Casting Distorted Crescent ===
This the most important skill to have as an Oboro and yet it is the most frustrating one to use. One of the easiest way to get the ATK buff is by making sure that your Max HP is even. By doing so, you can ensure the buff by using Pure Soul to recover your HP and then cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] on yourself.
If you are in a party with other people, try to always have your Party Window open to see the current HP of your teammates. Most physical attackers will see a huge jump in their damage and they will definitely love you for it. To make my job easier, I usually only use this buff on players with even Max HP and wait until they are fully healed before casting this spell.

While it is relatively straightforward to use [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] to buff your ATK, it is very frustrating to use it on your Magic Oboro. To get the MATK bonus, you will need to have even current SP by the time you finish casting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] ('''Not before Casting the Skill!'''). Because of this, I will recommend having odd Max SP and casting it right after you have recovered all of your SP using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul] and before using [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night]. This is very important because [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night] will continuously drains your SP and most likely screw up your timing.
[[File: DisortedMaxHPSP.gif|none|frame|Casting Distorted Crescent on Fully Healed Characters]]
What happen if you are in the middle of [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night] buff then? There is no real easy way to handle this situation as it all depends on your [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] cast time. For my Oboro, I can manage to cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] in less than 1 second, meaning that I can wait my SP to be at an odd number and then quickly cast the spell. Some of you may find it better to cast it when your current SP is at an even number. Practice makes perfect.
[[File:Disorted16thNight.gif|none|frame|Casting Distorted Crescent under 16th Night Buff]]

=== Utilizing Blaze Shield to Activate Isilla Cards and Runaway Magic/Lucky Day Temporal Boots Effect ===
I think Blaze Shield is a bit underrated on Magic Kagerou/Oboro. While it is not as good as Mage’s [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Fire_Wall Fire Wall], you can utilize this spell to quickly activate your {{item |id=4412  &lt;nowiki>Isilla Card&lt;/nowiki>}} and {{item |id=4876  &lt;nowiki>Runaway Magic&lt;/nowiki>}} or {{item |id=4880  &lt;nowiki>Lucky Day&lt;/nowiki>}} Temporal Boots enchantment. If you use it to damage 3+ enemies, you will most likely get the bonus effect on you.
[[File: BlazeShieldTrick_Scaled.gif|none|frame|Blaze Shield and Isilla Card Combo]]

=== Moving with Pure Soul ===
[http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul] allows you to regenerate your HP and SP at a rapid rate. Furthermore, you will also have chance to dodge any physical and magical attack. As good as it may sound, it comes with a huge drawback. Under this effect, you can’t manually move your character. This is the main reason why [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Hiding Shadow Hiding] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shadow_Leap Shadow Leap] skills are crucial for any Kagerou/Oboro.
[[File: ShadowHidingLeapTricks.gif|none|frame|Shadow Leap and Shadow Hiding Trick]]

=== General Early Levelling Guide ===
This is what I do to quickly level up all of my characters, not exclusive to Kagerou/Oboro. Please note that this is my personal preference and you can definitely grind somewhere else or do other quests than the one mentioned below.

'''Level 1-8''': Get off Airship and talk to Hun in front of the Criatura Academy. Drink the apple juice and talk to him again. Enter the Academy afterwards and register to get to level 8 and job level 10. You should be able to change into your first job class (Ninja) before continuing further. Prioritize on increasing your STR, followed by AGI and DEX since you will use Throwing Skills to level up in the early game.

'''Level 8-9''': Go one map South of Prontera and kill Porings here until you reach level 9 or have enough skill points on your first damage skill (I will suggests getting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Shuriken Throw Shuriken] for Ninjas, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Double_Strafe Double Strafe] for Archers, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Bash Bash] for Swordmen, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Napalm_Beat Napalm Beat]> [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Soul_Strike Soul Strike] for Mages, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Heal Heal] for Acolytes, etc.)

'''Level 9-26''': Warp to Payon Dungeon and kill zombies there with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Shuriken Throw Shuriken]. Try to get [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Shuriken Throw Shuriken] to level 5 and work towards [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai], followed by [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cicada_Skin_Shed Cicada Skin Shed]. You can buy {{item |id=13258  &lt;nowiki>Heat Wave Kunai&lt;/nowiki>}} to help you kill Skeletons in there. For other classes, you should work towards your AoE skills ([http://irowiki.org/wiki/Arrow_Shower Arrow Shower] for Archers, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Magnum_Break Magnum Break] for Swordmans, [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Fire_Wall Fire Wall] for Mages, etc.). If you are playing Merchant, you will only need [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cart_Revolution Cart Revolution] until you hit level 85 if you max your cart weight. Sadly, Acolytes can only rely on [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Heal Heal] to kill undead enemies; however, it should be alright if you follow this levelling guide.

'''Level 26-32''': Go to eden (@go eden) and join the Eden Group by talking to Secretary Lime Evenor. After joining Eden Group, talk to Instructor Boya to get the quest in Payon Dungeon. The Eden NPC Karl for the quest (Karl) can be found just outside the dungeon. Follow the quest chain and kill the instructed mobs until he sends you back to Instructor Boya. After talking to Boya, you can receive your Eden Gears from Administrator Michael by entering the Iron Door to your right and taking the North warp.

'''Level 32-70''': You can either go with your current build and spam [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai] or reset your Stats and Skills to Magic Build. If you prefer Magic Build, you should get INT, followed by DEX, and get Blaze Shield and Exploding Dragons to kill mobs more effectively. Personally, I prefer to just stick with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Throw_Kunai Throw Kunai] since you can easily kill any mobs that you desired with elemental Kunais. Warp to Orc Dungeon and start levelling there with your AoE skills to get to level 70. There is another Eden Equipment Quest in this dungeon which you can get from Instructor Boya at level 50-59.

'''Level 70-85''': It is now the time to do another Eden Equipment Quest. Talk to Instructor Ur and get the quest in Glast Heim. You can find the NPC at Glast Heim St. Abbey. Just follow the quest line until you can claim your rewards. You should have no problem to one-shot Wraiths and Evil Druid with 90ish STR as a Ninja. You can use this chance to try your luck in getting {{item |id=4141  &lt;nowiki>Evil Druid Card&lt;/nowiki>}} which can fetch a good amount of Zenny.

'''Level 85-99''': You can either find Gramps party now or do board quests in Eden. To do gramps, take the hunting quests at Monthly Hunt Quest Board at the NorthWest Corner in Eden HQ. After that you can speak to gramps to warp you to the hunting location. Alternatively, you can just do other board quests in Eden. Keep in mind that you can take another Eden Equipment quest at level 90 to enchant your Eden Weapon.

'''Level 99+''': You can now change into a Kagerou/Oboro and should be able to hunt wherever you want. Gramps is always a nice place to get levels especially if you get a good party. I will suggest learning [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/16th_Night 16th Night], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] (Oboro), Elemental Charms, and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Pure_Soul Pure Soul] as soon as possible for Throwing Kagerou/Oboro. Those skills, with the exception of [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swirling_Petal Swirling Petal], are also very important for Magic Kagerou/Oboro.
