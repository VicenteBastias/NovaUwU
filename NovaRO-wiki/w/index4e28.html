__TOC__

==Notice==
Hello, I will no longer be updating this guide.

== &lt;span style="color:rgb(153,199,103); font-family: sans-serif; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black; font-size: 2rem">Overview&lt;/span> ==
Hi, I'm Ara, and welcome to my Sorcerer guide. :> I've been playing Sorcerer for a while, and I thought I'd share some stuff I've learned, lol. My discord is &lt;b>Ara#6193&lt;/b> if you have any questions, or if you think I missed something/got something wrong. Thank you!&lt;br \>&lt;br \>

Sorcerers excel at inflicting and boosting elemental (Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind) damage, as well as supporting allies with their various buffs. They're also a nice source of &lt;s>Vitamin C&lt;/s> SP, with Health Conversion and Soul Change. As long as you keep a sorc healed up (and they have at least 5 SP), your party should never be running out of SP.

== &lt;span style="color:rgb(153,199,103); font-family: sans-serif; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black; font-size: 2rem">Stats&lt;/span> ==
I've listed some of the more important things that each of the 6 stats increase. Keep in mind that TOTAL stats means the total of base stats + bonuses.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;p>'''STR''' - '''Recommended: 1-60.'''&lt;/p> &lt;p>Used mostly to increase carrying capacity. As a Sorcerer, you'll be carrying a lot of materials, be it Gemstones, Potions, or Cool Rocks That You Use To Summon Things. Only base STR will increase carrying capacity, bonus STR from buffs and equipment will not.&lt;/p>
&lt;li>&lt;p>'''AGI''' - '''Recommended: Varies.'''&lt;/p> &lt;p> Increases ASPD and FLEE. Since many Sorcerer spells have hard cooldowns (not reduced by ACD), ASPD isn't too useful for us UNLESS you're playing a fleetank (tank hits by dodging them with FLEE) or a Spellfist build.  100 total AGI will make you immune to Sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;li>&lt;p>'''VIT''' - '''Recommended: 100+ Total''' &lt;/p> &lt;p>Increases MaxHP and DEF. Although Sorcerers's base HP is one of the worst, having a bit more HP will allow you to not die when sacrificing your own HP in Health Conversion. Remember that Sorcerer is mainly a support class, and you need to be alive to support your party members! 100 Total VIT will make you immune to Stun.
&lt;li>&lt;p>'''INT''' - '''Recommended: 120''' &lt;/p> &lt;p>Increases MATK, MDEF, and maxSP. Many Sorcerer spells also use INT directly in its damage calculation, so having as much INT as you can is a good idea. Soul Change also gives your target SP equal to half of your current SP, so higher maxSP will let you give more SP to allies. INT also reduces variable cast time by a little bit. 100 total INT will make you immune to Silence and Blind.&lt;/p>
&lt;li>&lt;p>'''DEX''' - '''Recommended: 1 or 120, depending on your build.''' &lt;/p> &lt;p>Reduces variable cast time. Keep in mind that you need '''(DEX * 2) + INT = 530''' to achieve 0 variable cast time. If you plan on using {{Item List2 |id=22010 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, you will need at least 120 DEX. If you plan on using {{Item List2 |id=22197 |item=Illusion Leg B-Type |slots=1 |simple=yes}} AND plan on reaching fast casting via stacking VCT% on your gears, you may take 1 base DEX.&lt;/p>
&lt;li>&lt;p>'''LUK''' - '''Recommended: 1-60.''' &lt;/p> &lt;p>Increases.... many things. Notable for us is that it increases MATK (though not as much as INT) and Perfect Dodge. LUK gives resistances to many statuses (such as Stone Curse and Frozen) but does not make you immune to them at 100 total LUK. 100 total LUK will, however, make you immune to Curse. 0 total LUK (from -LUK from Essence of Evil VIT 3) will also make you immune to Curse. But I mostly suggest you can carry Panacea or Holy Water if you really don't want to be cursed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/ul>

|-
| {{Skill List |id=9 |skill=Increase SP Recovery |simple=yes}}
| Increases natural SP recovery and SP recovery from consumables. 
'''Max level: 10'''
| Exactly what the skill name is: Increases SP Recovery. If you don't have anything to do with your points, throwing them in here isn't a bad choice. Not only does it improve your natural SP recovery, it makes your SP pots better, so you technically save money.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=10 |skill=Sight |simple=yes}}
| Reveals hidden units around you.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| Useful for revealing hidden units around you!
|-
| {{Skill List |id=11 |skill=Napalm Beat |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Ghost Property damage to a target.
'''Max level: 10'''
| I pretty much only have this because it's a prereq for Safety Wall.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=12 |skill=Safety Wall|simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Blue Gemstone to place a barrier on the ground. Standing in the barrier will block melee hits until the duration runs out, you take a certain amount of hits, or a hit exceeds the Safety Wall's HP. 
'''Max level: 10'''
| Higher levels will block more hits and last longer. Note that if the melee hit is like, super strong, it can break the safety wall in a single hit. On the other hand, very fast, weak hits can also shred a safety wall.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=13 |skill=Soul Strike |simple=yes}}
| Inflicts Ghost Property damage to a target. Does extra damage to Undead race enemies.
'''Max level: 10'''
| If you're leveling on Undead Monsters, you can consider using this skill, but I only take it as the prerequisite for Safety Wall. I prefer using Fireball, which does damage in an area, when I fight Undead monsters to level, since a lot of them tend to be both Undead Race and Element.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=14 |skill=Cold Bolt |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Water Property damage to a target.
'''Max level: 10'''
| Cold Bolt is a good choice to use with Spellfist, because Aqua's bonus MATK is more useful than Agni's bonus ATK when summoned.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=15 |skill=Frost Diver |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Water Property damage to a target, and has a chance to freeze the target.
'''Max level: 10'''
| I don't really use this, but I've seen some people use it in BG to apply Frozen to people. Also something easy to target in BG if you want to replace a Shadow Chaser's FSK with something easy to hit after you dispel them (also in BG).
|-
| {{Skill List |id=16 |skill=Stone Curse |simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Red Gemstone to attempt to inflict Stone Curse on a target.
'''Max level: 10'''
| At level 6+, failing the cast no longer consumes the gemstone. Keep in mind that the cast range for this skill is incredibly small. Like, melee range. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=17 |skill=Fire Ball|simple=yes}}
| Inflict Fire Property damage to a target and enemies surrounding the target. Enemies damaged by the splash will take 3/4ths the damage inflicted.
'''Max level: 10'''
| My go-to skill for leveling to 85. You'll want to group monsters together to use this efficiently.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=18 |skill=Fire Wall |simple=yes}}
| Place a Wall of Fire on the ground. Enemies that walk into the cells will be knocked back and take Fire Property damage. Each cell of Fire Wall will break after a certain amount of hits. Undead Enemies will not be knocked back, but will take the max amount of hits per cell and break each cell immediately into walking into it.
'''Max level: 10'''
|Alright I'm gonna be real, I suck at using this spell. But it's really good for leveling, keeps stuff away from you, and does a lot of damage to Undead stuff since they don't get knocked back, they just take all the damage head-on like a champ. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=19 |skill=Fire Bolt |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Fire Property damage to a target.
'''Max level: 10'''
|Use this before you get Fire Ball since you'll probably be in Payon Dungeon killing Zombies/Skeletons. 
'''Tip''': You can select the skill with your hotkey, and then scroll up and down to change the level you're casting this as. So you can calculate exactly what level you need to oneshot Zombies to save SP.  
You can also max this if you're playing a Spellfist build vs Undead or Earth element enemies.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=20 |skill=Lightning Bolt|simple=yes}}
| Inflict Wind Property damage to a target.
'''Max level: 10'''
|For Spellfist builds, or if you're leveling by killing Water element mobs before you become a Sorcerer. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=21 |skill=Thunderstorm |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Wind Property Damage to an area
'''Max level: 10'''
|I've literally never even seen this spell outside of some GMT mobs casting it.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=157 |skill=Energy Coat |simple=yes}}
| Reduce damage taken at the cost of losing SP every time you are hit. 
'''Max level: 1'''
|Even vs attacks that do "non-reducible damage," Energy Coat will reduce it. If you wanna be tankier at the cost of some SP drain, make sure to keep Energy Coat on. Keep in mind that it takes some of your SP every hit you take, so someone hitting you at 193 ASPD will shred your SP. At 0 SP, the next hit you take will cancel Energy Coat. The reduced damage depends on your current %SP, higher = more reduction.
Also, this is a Platinum Skill so it doesn't cost you points. Talk to the Platinum Skill NPC in the Main Office, Basement, if you are missing this skill.

|-
| {{Skill List |id=274 |skill=Advanced Book |simple=yes}}
| Increases ASPD and ATK when equipped with a Book weapon.
'''Max Level: 10'''
| For Spellfist builds, take level 10 for the 5% ASPD. The ATK is pretty whatever. Too bad it's not MATK. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=93 |skill=Sense |simple=yes}}
| Analyze an enemy, bringing up the monster's information up for your entire party.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| Useful to see monster's stats. In MH2, you can see a monster's remaining HP%.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=275 |skill=Cast Cancel |simple=yes}}
| Cancels a spell before casting is complete, and refunds a portion of the SP.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Nice when you're leveling, in case you want to stop a long cast, but usually unnecessary later on since everything is gonna be too fast for you to cancel anyway. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=276 |skill=Magic Rod |simple=yes}}
| Absorb a targetted magic spell cast on you and recover SP when successfully absorbed. Lose SP if the absorbed spell is Spellbreaker.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Lets you dodge single target magic for a short duration. If you time it well, you can dodge spells such as Fenrir's Tetra Vortex with this skill. Lower levels give lower ACD, so you can actually spam level 3 faster than level 5.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=277 |skill=Spellbreaker |simple=yes}}
| Cancels an enemy's spell, mid-cast. Successful Spelllbreaks will inflict 2% of the target's MaxHP. At level 5, successful Spellbreaks will also recover your own HP. Success chance is 10% on boss monsters.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Gives you a 10% chance to break a cast on an MVP monster, or 100% to break cast on a normal enemy. In parties, you can spam Spellbreak on bosses that have cast bars to cancel their mechanics.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=278 |skill=Free Cast |simple=yes}}
| Allows autoattacking and moving while casting spells. Attack Speed and Movement Speed are reduced during spell casts, higher levels reduce the penalty.
'''Max Level: 10'''
| Okay so... this used to be really cool, but there was a bugfix where it actually reduces your ASPD when casting now, so it's really bad unless you take it at level 10. This is since the aspd drop is so big that you go down to like 80~ ASPD, and you get super stuck in animation. Take to 10 or leave at 0.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=279 |skill=Autospell |simple=yes}}
| Grants a chance to automatically cast spells when autoattacking. Higher levels allow a greater pool of skills to be selected, and a higher chance to occur.
'''Max Level: 10'''
| Nice for Spellfist builds, combo it with Double Cast. It's nice because you can choose what type of bolts you want to autospell. Keep in mind that autocast skills using this WILL put you on aftercast delay.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=280 |skill=Flame Launcher |simple=yes}}
| Endows an ally's weapon with Fire Property. Increases an ally's Fire Property Magic damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Fire endow. Will override other Endows and Aspersio. Each skill level will increases the Fire Magic damage by 1%, so 5% at level 5.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=281 |skill=Frost Weapon |simple=yes}}
| Endows an ally's weapon with Water Property. Increases an ally's Water Property Magic damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Water endow. Max this to increase Diamond Dust damage passively. Will override other Endows and Aspersio. Each skill level will increases the Water Magic damage by 1%, so 5% at level 5.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=282 |skill=Lightning Loader |simple=yes}}
| Endows an ally's weapon with Wind Property. Increases an ally's Wind Property Magic damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Wind endow. Max this to increase Varetyr Spear damage passively. Will override other Endows and Aspersio. Each skill level will increases the Wind Magic damage by 1%, so 5% at level 5.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=283 |skill=Seismic Weapon |simple=yes}}
| Endows an ally's weapon with Earth Property. Increases an ally's Earth Property Magic damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Earth endow. Max this to increase Earth Grave damage passively. Will override other Endows and Aspersio. Each skill level will increases the Earth Magic damage by 1%, so 5% at level 5.

| Increase damage dealt to Dragon Race enemies, and reduces damage taken from Dragon Race enemies. Gives up to 5 INT.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Usually, just take this if you want the 5 INT. The Dragon resist is extremely useful for the Monster Hunter 2 Star Boss, Garronath.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=285 |skill=Volcano|simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Yellow Gemstone to create an area that increases ATK and Fire Property damage of all units standing in the area.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Great to use if Fire, Water, or Wind will not give elemental advantage to whatever you're fighting, and you don't need to be standing on a Land Protector. Wall of Fog cannot be cast on Volcano. 
Only one of Volcano, Deluge, Violent Gale, or Land Protector can be cast at a time by the same player. Subsequent casts will remove the current land effect. If you already have a Volcano, Deluge, or Violent Gale on the map (cast by you, not someone else), does not consume any Gemstones. Cannot be cast on any cells that are affected by any other skill.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=286 |skill=Deluge|simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Yellow Gemstone to create an area that increases MaxHP, Healing, and Water Property damage of all units standing in the area.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Wall of Fog's duration is doubled if cast on Deluge. 
Only one of Volcano, Deluge, Violent Gale, or Land Protector can be cast at a time by the same player. Subsequent casts will remove the current land effect. If you already have a Volcano, Deluge, or Violent Gale on the map (cast by you, not someone else), does not consume any Gemstones. Cannot be cast on any cells that are affected by any other skill.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=287 |skill=Violent Gale|simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Yellow Gemstone to create an area that increases Flee and Wind Property damage of all units standing in the area.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Wall of Fog cannot be cast on Violent Gale. 
Only one of Volcano, Deluge, Violent Gale, or Land Protector can be cast at a time by the same player. Subsequent casts will remove the current land effect. If you already have a Volcano, Deluge, or Violent Gale on the map (cast by you, not someone else), does not consume any Gemstones. Cannot be cast on any cells that are affected by any other skill.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=288 |skill=Land Protector |simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Yellow Gemstone and 1 Blue Gemstone to protect an area, and no ground-based skills will be able to be cast on affected cells.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Gets rid of land-based effects in the aoe, and prevents targetting of land-based magic on the affected areas. Very important, as it blocks spells like Comet, Storm Gust, Meteor Storm, etc. so that your party isn't wiped/hitlocked/knocked back. Does not work vs physical skills (Dragon Breath, Rapid Throw, etc.) or non-ground skills. If you cast an LP on a different Sorcerer's LP, the overlapping section will be removed. Only one of Volcano, Deluge, Violent Gale, or Land Protector can be cast at a time by the same player. Subsequent casts will remove the current land effect.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=289 |skill=Dispel |simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Yellow Gemstone to remove buffs and debuffs from the target.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Removes many, but not all, buffs and debuffs from the target. This is usually used to remove skills like Defender, Reflect Shield, Hallucination Walk, Max Pain, and Agi Up (not a full list) from enemies so that your ally DPS can do damage better. You can also dispel your allies to remove debuffs.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=290 |skill=Abracadabra |simple=yes}}
| Consume 2 Yellow Gemstones to cast a random skill.
'''Max Level: 10'''
| This skill is extremely random. Higher levels give a larger pool of possible skills. Level 6 is used to tame monsters. Level 10 is used for the possibility of transforming monsters into MVPs. 
Each cast has a chance to give you a skill called "????" which can either tame monsters, transform a monster into a MVP, transform a monster into a Poring, or instantly kill a monster. You cannot reduce the cost of this skill below 1 Yellow Gemstone.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=373 |skill=Health Conversion |simple=yes}}
| Converts a portion of your HP into SP.
'''In MH2:''' Grants a new status to the caster which increases all elemental magic damage done by 1% per level for 30 seconds.

'''Max Level: 5'''
| Use this with Soul Exchange to charge your SP, then give SP to your allies. Remember, the SP cost for this skill is 5 SP, so if you go under 5 SP you'll have to recover some SP first before using it. Also be sure not to die when you're low HP because of this skill.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=374 |skill=Soul Change |simple=yes}}
| Exchange your SP with an ally. Half of both player's are consumed in this exchange. 
'''In MH2:''' Reduces target's SP consumption of skills by 30% for 30 seconds.

'''Max Level: 1'''
| Swaps your SP with your target ally's SP, and then halve both. For example, if you have 200 SP and your target has 50 SP, afterwards you have 25 and your target has 100. To target an ally, either use the party menu or shift-click on their sprite. When used on a monster, restore 3% SP.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=375 |skill=Soul Burn |simple=yes}}
| Has a chance to reduce a target's SP to 0. On failure, will reduce your own SP to 0. At level 5, will also do damage on the affected player.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| I believe this only works in PvP, but gives a chance to drain all of your target's SP. If you fail, you drain all your SP instead, so be careful and carry SP potions if you use this. At level 5, will also do damage to your target on success and yourself on failure. Chance doesn't increase from level 4 to 5, so if you wanna use it in PvP you usually use level 4 to save you a skill point, since you save a skill point and the damage is negligible anyway.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=402 |skill=Mind Breaker |simple=yes}}
| Increases an enemy's MATK by 100% while decreasing their Soft MDEF. Only works on PvP maps.
'''In MH2:''' Reduces a Monster's MDEF by 3% per level for everyone attacking the monster or 9% per level for Sorcerers for 60 seconds. The Monster deals increased elemental damage by 1% per level (5% at max).

'''Max Level: 5'''
| This skill is now disabled in WoE! There's no point in using this skill!!!
...Except in MH2, if your or a magical ally's MDEF pierce is not 100%. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=403 |skill=Memorize |simple=yes}}
| Halves the variable cast time of the next 5 skill casts.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| Useful for when you're leveling, but won't be super useful during mid to endgame. Plus, doesn't affect fixed cast. This is consumed by any skill cast, including any skill that has no cast time at all.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=404 |skill=Wall of Fog |simple=yes}}
| Covers an area in Fog. Units in Fog will take 75% less damage from ranged autoattacks, and 25% reduced damage from ranged skills. In addition, any skills targeted into the affected area has a 75% chance to fail.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| Kind of like Pneuma, but only reduces ranged damage instead of dodging it completely. It's nice in that you can safety wall inside it, so you can block melee attacks and also reduce incoming ranged damage by an entire 75%. Not only that, but there's an increased chance for ranged attacks to miss, and targeted skills targets inside the fog has a 75% failure rate. Put a point in here, it'll be worth it.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=405 |skill=Spider Web|simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Cobweb to snare an enemy. Fire damage against webbed enemies will do double damage, but destroy the web.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| You can only Spider Web up to 2 targets at a time, and the limit lasts until the visual effect disappears. It's removable by land-clear, such as Land Protector, so if you LP your own Spider Web, you can cast another one since it's gone. Doesn't work in instances.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=90 |skill=Earth Spike |simple=yes}}
| Inflicts Earth Property damage to a target.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Hey remember Fire/Ice/Lightning Bolt from the Mage branch? It's like that, but Earth, and doesn't even work with Spellfist. :)
|-
| {{Skill List |id=91 |skill=Heaven's Drive |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Earth Property damage to an area.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Usually you use this in PvP modes. You can use this to reveal a Doram using the Doram Hide (where they turn into a bush) or get rid of Silvervine Root Twist (the Doram root) by casting it under whoever's rooted. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=1008 |skill=Elemental Change (Water) |simple=yes}}
{{Skill List |id=1017 |skill=Elemental Change (Earth) |simple=yes}}

{{Skill List |id=1018 |skill=Elemental Change (Fire) |simple=yes}}

{{Skill List |id=1019 |skill=Elemental Change (Wind) |simple=yes}}
| Change a target's element. Consumes 1 Elemental Converter (Water/Earth/Fire/Wind) depending on which one was used.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| Consumes an Elemental Converter of the same element to have a chance to change a monster's Element. The resulting element will always be level 1.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=1007 |skill=Create Elemental Converter |simple=yes}}
| Create an Elemental Converter. 
Water Converter: 1 Crystal Blue, 1 Blank Scroll

Earth Converter: 1 Green Live, 1 Blank Scroll

Fire Converter: 1 Red Blood, 1 Blank Scroll

Wind Converter: 1 Wind of Verdue, 1 Blank Scroll

'''Max Level: 1'''
| There's a NPC in the Main Office that does the exact same thing btw.

|-
| {{Skill List |id=2443 |skill=Fire Walk |simple=yes}}
| Allows you to leave behind a trail of Fire where you walk. Enemies that walk on the affected areas will take Fire Property damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| I've been told that this skill's decent for {{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}} builds, but I've never personally tried it. Doubt it's that great.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2444 |skill=Electric Walk |simple=yes}}
| Allows you to leave behind a trail of Lightning where you walk. Enemies that walk on the affected areas will take Wind Property damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Same as Fire Walk... but Electric(wind)! 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}}
| Cancels a bolt skill mid-cast, and channels the damage into your next autoattacks.
'''Max Level: 10'''
| This skill can only be cast during the cast time of a Bolt attack. That is, Cold Bolt, Fire Bolt, or Lightning Bolt. Spellfist has a completely different build from normal sorcerer, so make sure you don't end up insta-casting bolts or else you're not going to be able to use this at all. Only works with manually casted bolts, so autocast bolts will not be able to be canceled into Spellfist. Your next couple melee attacks will do magic melee damage depending on bolt damage. Bolt-boosting cards and effects (Ju card, Imp card, etc.) will increase this damage. Dark Claw (the GX skill) will boost this skill. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2446 |skill=Earth Grave |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Earth Property damage to an area. Can hit and reveal hidden targets.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Does respectable damage while revealing hidden targets. Keep in mind that it will NOT cancel or hurt someone using the Doram Hide (the thing where they turn into a bush).  Does more damage based off the level of Seismic Weapon (Earth Endow) you have.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2447 |skill=Diamond Dust |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Water Property damage to an area. Can Crystallize targets. 
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Crystallize is a very strong debuff in PvP modes. Affected units cannot cast skills, move, or use any items, and the only way to end Crystallize before the timer runs out is Clearance/Lauda Agnus from an Arch Bishop, Dispel/Warmer from a Sorcerer, Banishing Buster from an enemy Rebel, or being hit by any type of fire damage. Crystallized targets take more damage from Wind Property damage. In PvM, non-boss protocol monsters can also be Crystallized, but they will only be rooted for the duration. They will be able to hit you if you're within range, but they will not move. Does more damage based off the level of Frost Weapon (Water Endow) you have.
This skill is also one of the main damage skills for Caster builds.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2448 |skill=Poison Buster |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Poison Property damage to an enemy and a 7x7 area around it. Damage is increased if the enemy is affected by the Cloud Poison status.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Apparently this skill does a good chunk of damage, but it has a cooldown. In addition, there's no poison magic boosting cards/equipment that I know of, so I wouldn't recommend investing into it.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2449 |skill=Psychic Wave |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Neutral Property damage to an area. If the Sorcerer has a summoned Elemental Spirit at level 2, set to Passive Mode, Psychic Wave will do damage of the same element as the Elemental Spirit instead of Neutral.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Your main damage skill. Each tick of damage counts as a separate "hit," in a sense, so there's up to 7 chances per Psychic Wave to trigger on-hit effects such as Runaway Magic from Temporal Boots or Wickebine's Cat Ears' MDEF pierce. Does Neutral damage by default, but lets you use 4 other elements as well. 
This skill is one of the main damage skills for Caster builds.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2450 |skill=Cloud Kill |simple=yes}}
| Place a Poison Cloud on a 7x7 area. Enemies inside the area will take Poison Element damage and have a chance to be inflicted by the Cloud Poison status. Cloud Poisoned enemies will take additional damage from Poison property attacks.
'''In MH2:''' Reduced the effectiveness of "Cloud Poison" to 10% at max level or 25% for Sorcerers. 

'''Max Level: 5'''
| A very good skill to proc on-hit effects with. At max level, it will do 48 ticks of damage over the entire duration, which is 48 changes for you to proc Runaway Magic, Wickebines', or whatever else you have.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2451 |skill=Striking |simple=yes}}
| Buff an ally, giving them additional ATK and Perfect HIT. This skill's level increases Varetyr Spear damage.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Perfect Hit is nice for allies that don't do crit damage (Wind Cutter RKs, Picky Peck Dorams, etc.) if they need to hit something with AGI Up.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2452 |skill=Warmer |simple=yes}}
| Place a Warmer on an area. Units inside the warmer heal a % of their Max HP every couple seconds. Units inside Warmer cannot be Frozen, Freezing, or Crystallized.
'''In MH2:''' Cures and prevents the same statuses as Herbal Remedy.

'''Max Level: 5'''
| Combined with Agni level 2 in Passive mode, this little fire thing heals a lot of HP. At higher levels, its fixed cast is reduced but cooldown is increased. I like to use it at level 2 or 3 so I can move it around a bit more.  If you cast Warmer on a unit with one of those 3 cold looking debuffs, it will get rid of it. Notably, YOU CAN CAST THIS ON ENEMIES. You CAN, but you SHOULDN'T. The maxHP recovery is extremely strong on high health bosses, so be careful. If you're using this to heal or something during a boss fight, take care to not let the boss stay in the Warmer. Get rid of it with Land Protector if you have to.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2453 |skill=Vacuum Extreme |simple=yes}}
| Place a small tornado thing on an area. Enemies inside the small tornado thing will be unable to move for a short period of time.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| An AoE root. Enemies who pass through this will be rooted for a couple seconds, reduced by their Base STR. Works kind of weirdly vs players, since players are stopped only when they reach their current movement. So if someone walks through your vacuum by clicking on a cell that isn't part of the AoE, they'll finish walking before they stop. Disabled in most instances, and doesn't work on bosses. Also Disabled in Battlegrounds.

Basically, usable in fields vs normal Monsters and in War of Emperium.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2454 |skill=Varetyr Spear |simple=yes}}
| Inflict Wind Property damage to a target and surrounding enemies. Has a chance to Stun. 
'''Max Level: 10'''
| Unlike Diamond Dust and Earth Grave, it's a targeted spell that has an AoE instead of being ground-based, similar to a Ranger's Arrow Storm. This means that you can use it on enemies standing on LP. This skill gets a lot of boost from stuff like Old Wind Whisper (from Bio5) and Celia Alde Card (also from Bio5). Does more damage based off the level of Lightning Loader (Wind Endow) and Striking that you have.

Usable as a damage skill in Caster builds.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2455 |skill=Arrullo |simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Yellow Gemstone for a chance to inflict Deep Sleep status to an area.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| An extremely strong skill in PvP modes, since there's no way to completely resist Deep Sleep. Chance scales with your INT.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2456 |skill=Elemental Control |simple=yes}}
| Change your Elemental Spirit's mode.
'''Max Level: 4'''
| Commands your Elemental to change modes. Level 1 is Passive, 2 is Defensive, 3 is Offensive, and 4....kills your elemental.
:'''Passive:''' Gives various buffs to you.
:'''Defensive:''' Gives various usually-defensive buffs to you.
:'''Offensive:''' Commands your Elemental to attack.
Cast the same level twice to return it to Idle mode (not the same as Passive) where it doesn't do anything. When your Elemental runs out of SP, it will automatically go into Passive (level 1) mode.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2457 |skill=Summon Agni |simple=yes}}
| Consume 3 Red Blood/6 Red Blood/1 Flame Heart to Summon Agni, the Elemental Spirit of Fire
'''Max Level: 3'''
| Agni's main stat is ATK, so you don't really get much from that. He even looks buff. Notably, Agni level 2 on Passive mode will make your Warmer heal a lot more than normal. It costs 3 Red Blood to summon level 1, 6 Red Blood to summon level 2, and 1 Flame Heart to summon level 3.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2458 |skill=Summon Aqua |simple=yes}}
| Consume 3 Crystal Blue/6 Crystal Blue/1 Mystic Frozen to Summon Aqua, the Elemental Spirit of Water
'''Max Level: 3'''
| Aqua's main stat is MATK, which makes it ideal for when you just want more damage magic damage. Notable things Aqua can do include Level 1 on Defensive Mode giving you a mini Devotion, and Level 2 on Passive gives additional Crystallization chance on {{Skill List |id=2447 |skill=Diamond Dust |simple=yes}}.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2459 |skill=Summon Ventus |simple=yes}}
| Consume 3 Wind of Verdue/6 Wind of Verdue/1 Rough Wind to Summon Ventus, the Elemental Spirit of Wind
'''Max Level: 3'''
| Ventus likes to increase ASPD and reduce Fixed Cast Time. Any level Ventus on Passive Mode will increase your ASPD by 5 and reduce your FCT by 1 second, which allows you to instacast a lot of your skills. Ventus level 1 on Defensive Mode will let you run fast and dodge things with the increased movement speed and FLEE. It's my favorite.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2460 |skill=Summon Tera |simple=yes}}
| Consume 3 Green Live/6 Green Live/1 Great Nature to Summon Tera, the Elemental Spirit of Earth
'''Max Level: 3'''
| Tera has survivability stuff, like DEF and HP. That's about it. Yup.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2461 |skill=Elemental Action |simple=yes}}
| Commands your Elemental to attack once.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| For those who actually just wanted to play Pokemon, but didn't want to raise a Homunculus on a Genetic. Your elemental may take aggro/damage when you use this, so not recommended to use. They don't do much damage anyway.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2462 |skill=Four Spirit Analysis |simple=yes}}
| Changes Flame Heart, Mystic Frozen, Rough Wind, or Great Nature into Red Blood, Crystal Blue, Wind of Verdue, or Green Lives, or the latter into the former.
'''Max Level: 2'''
| Level 1 changes Flame Heart, Mystic Frozen, Rough Wind, or Great Nature into Red Blood, Crystal Blue, Wind of Verdue, or Green Lives. How many are produced are random (6-10). Level 2 converts 10 of the lesser stones into 1 greater one. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2463 |skill=Spirit Sympathy |simple=yes}}
| Allows your Elemental Spirit to have more MaxHP, and reduces your own SP Consumption.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| I personally don't use this at all, since Elementals die really easily either way, and I've got HP Conversion to keep my SP up.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5008 |skill=Elemental Shield |simple=yes}}
| Consume 1 Blue Gemstone and your current Elemental Spirit to cast Safety Wall and Pneuma on all party members on your screen.
'''Max Level: 5'''
| Your Elemental Spirit will die when you cast this. :( 
This is the only way to cast both Pneuma and Safety Wall on the same cell. Higher Levels only increase duration of the SW/Pneuma, so if you do take this, I recommend only taking this at level 1 since the SW/Pneuma duration seems to already be higher than the normal skills.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2464 |skill=Spirit Cure |simple=yes}}
| Consume 10% of your own HP and SP to restore 10% of your Elemental's HP and SP.
'''Max Level: 1'''
| Honestly I like to just summon a new Elemental Spirit, but this is nice if your Summon spell is on cooldown still. Also saves you some Materials. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2465 |skill=Fire Insignia |simple=yes}}
| Place a Fire Insignia on the floor. Units inside any Fire Insignia will take 50% more damage from Water Element damage. Fire Element units will regain a % of their maxHP every couple seconds, while Earth Element units will lose a % of their maxHP every couple seconds. 
'''In MH2:''' The 50% boost only applies to damage from Sorcerers. Units inside the insignia will take 20% instead of 50% more damage from Water element from non-Sorcerer classes.

'''Max Level: 3'''
| In addition to the effects listed that every Fire Insignia has, each level of Fire Insignia will do something different. 
:'''Level 1''' increases natural SP and HP recovery of Agni when he's in the Fire Insignia. &lt;/li>
:'''Level 2''' will endow units inside with Fire Element weapon, increase Fire Property Physical damage by 10%, and give +50 ATK.
:'''Level 3''' will boost Fire Property Magic damage by 25% and give +50 MATK. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2466 |skill=Water Insignia |simple=yes}}
| Place a Water Insignia on the floor. Units inside any Water Insignia will take 50% more damage from Wind Element damage. Water Element units will regain a % of their maxHP every couple seconds, while Fire Element units will lose a % of their maxHP every couple seconds. 
'''In MH2:''' The 50% boost only applies to damage from Sorcerers. Units inside the insignia will take 20% instead of 50% more damage from Wind element from non-Sorcerer classes.

'''Max Level: 3'''
| In addition to the effects listed that every Water Insignia has, each level of Water Insignia will do something different. 
:'''Level 1''' increases natural SP and HP recovery of Aqua when she's in the Water Insignia. &lt;/li>
:'''Level 2''' will endow units inside with Water Element weapon, increase Water Property Physical damage by 10%, and boost incoming healing by 10%. 
:'''Level 3''' will boost Water Property Magic damage by 25% and reduce Aftercast Delay of Water Magic spells by 30%. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2467 |skill=Wind Insignia |simple=yes}}
| Place a Wind Insignia on the floor. Units inside any Wind Insignia will take 50% more damage from Earth Element damage. Wind Element units will regain a % of their maxHP every couple seconds, while Water Element units will lose a % of their maxHP every couple seconds. 
'''In MH2:''' The 50% boost only applies to damage from Sorcerers. Units inside the insignia will take 20% instead of 50% more damage from Earth element from non-Sorcerer classes.

'''Max Level: 3'''
| In addition to the effects listed that every Wind Insignia has, each level of Wind Insignia will do something different. 
:'''Level 1''' increases natural SP and HP recovery of Ventus when she's in the Wind Insignia. &lt;/li>
:'''Level 2''' will endow units inside with Wind Element weapon, increase Wind Property Physical damage by 10%, and grant 10% ASPD. 
:'''Level 3''' will boost Wind Property Magic damage by 25% and reduce Aftercast Delay of Wind Magic spells by 50%. 
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2468 |skill=Earth Insignia |simple=yes}}
| Place a Earth Insignia on the floor. Units inside any Earth Insignia will take 50% more damage from Fire Element damage. Earth Element units will regain a % of their maxHP every couple seconds, while Wind Element units will lose a % of their maxHP every couple seconds. 
'''In MH2:''' The 50% boost only applies to damage from Sorcerers. Units inside the insignia will take 20% instead of 50% more damage from Fire element from non-Sorcerer classes.

:'''Level 1''' increases natural SP and HP recovery of Tera when he's in the Wind Insignia. &lt;/li>
:'''Level 2''' will endow units inside with Earth Element weapon, increase Earth Property Physical damage by 10%, and grant +500 MaxHP and +50 DEF. 
:'''Level 3''' will boost Earth Property Magic damage by 25% and grant +50 MaxSP and +50 MDEF.

||Your very first Sorcerer-only hat! Until you get something better, you can use this. It's got a slot too, so you can put in something useful for early leveling, like {{Item List2 |id=4412 |item=Isilla Card}}.

Mainly boosts {{Skill List |id=2454 |skill=Varetyr Spear |simple=yes}}, but you can get {{Item List |id=29071 |item=Magic Essence |simple=yes}} enchants on it, which reduces fixed cast time by .1 second per level of the enchant. This lets you get instacast on a lot of your skills without having to use Ventus on Passive.

||Unlike the earlier wave of GC/EVT hats (Spell Circuit, Amistr Beret, etc.) these only need +11 for .2s FCT. Ideally you get this to +11 or +12 for full bonuses. Beats {{Item List2 |id=18980 |item=Old Wind Whisper |slots=1 |simple=yes}} on non-Varetyr Spear builds, especially vs Small or Medium monsters. 
This one increases damage of {{Skill List |id=2449 |skill=Psychic Wave |simple=yes}} if used with Rutilus Stick-OS, but you probably won't be using Rutilus later on since it's outclassed by the EDDA weapons. However, these hats are still good even without the combo.

These don't have any combos for Sorcerers, but if you plan on making a Comet Warlock, Ceremonial has a combo with Rutilus Stick-OS for that, while Antiquity is used on Soul Reaper builds. Good even without any combo for Sorcerer though.

:If refine rate is 9 or higher, increase neutral and shadow property magic damage by 10%.
:If refine rate is 11 or higher, increase water, wind, earth and fire property magic damage by 10%.
:Each refine rate above 10 will reduces fixed casting time by 0.1 second (up to 15).

||If you combo this with a {{Item List2 |id=1654 |item=Mental Stick |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, it boosts your {{Skill List |id=2449 |skill=Psychic Wave |simple=yes}}'s damage massively. If you can get a +11 or higher, you can also reduce some FCT but it's pretty hard to get. This hat is really nice to have though!

:Increases critical attack damage by 10%.
:Adds 5% chance magical defense ignored for 5 seconds when dealing magical damage.
:FLEE +10
||MDEF scaling is really hard on magic classes. The 100% MDEF pierce is really good vs both high and low MDEF enemies, and 5% proc is actually really easy since it's a chance per tic of damage per enemy.That's to say, if you cast a level 5 {{Skill List |id=2449 |skill=Psychic Wave |simple=yes}} that hits 10 enemies for 7 hits each, that's 70 chances for the 5% proc.
|-
||{{Item List2 |id=5464 |item=Zaha Doll Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
||Siege Token Shop, Summer Festival (Plushie Claw), Weekly Coin Shop
||
:INT +3, MDEF +9.
:Increase Magic Damage to Undead by 10%.
:When using or receiving magic attacks, you have a chance of transforming into the fairy 'Bacsojin'.
:While transformed, you drain SP by 10 per second and you gain increased magical damage.
:The refine rate increases the duration and the damage increase of the transformation.
||For every refine on a Zaha Doll Hat, the proc will reduce your fixed cast by .8 seconds. This allows you to get instacast on your spells with more than .5 seconds of fixed cast time without using Ventus, but it's not really that reliable.

:MATK +2%
:If refined to +5 or higher, adds an additional MATK +3%.
:If refined to +7 or higher, adds an additional MATK +3%.
:If equipped in combination with {{Item List2 |id=2286|item=Elven Ears |simple=yes}}, decreases the SP cost of skills by 3%.
:If equipped in combination with {{Item List2 |id=1615 |item=Evil Bone Wand |slots=0 |simple=yes}}, each refine on the weapon adds MATK +10. If the {{Item List2 |id=1615 |item=Evil Bone Wand |slots=0 |simple=yes}} is refined to +10, reduces cast time of skill by 10%.
:If equipped in combination with {{Item List2 |id=1636 |item=Thorn Staff of Darkness |slots=0 |simple=yes}}, each refine on the weapon adds MATK +10. If the {{Item List2 |id=1636 |item=Thorn Staff of Darkness |slots=0 |simple=yes}} is refined to +10, reduces cast time of skills by 10%.
||If you're using a {{Item List2 |id=1636 |item=Thorn Staff of Darkness |slots=0 |simple=yes}} as your weapon, this hat helps a lot with damage and cast time. If that's your weapon choice, this usable for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with it, since by itself it just gives MATK, and the combo with Elven Ears isn't needed because you shouldn't have too much SP problems.

:If Archer, DEX +3, increase long distance physical attack power 10%.
||If you've got one of these sitting around because you use it on Ranger or something, you can throw it on your Sorcerer for leveling or just for the stat boost. It's not stellar, but it helps with cast and gives a little bit of MATK.

||Pretty much the best {{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}} build hat. Increases bolt damage, and gives +5 ASPD at +9. Getting a +9 of this lets you use different elementals, so you don't need to count on Ventus for its ASPD boost.

:If refine rate is 7 or higher, increases Fire Bolt and Lightning Bolt damage by 25%.
:If refine rate is 9 or higher, increases attack speed (reduces delay after attack by 10%).
:If refine rate is 11 or higher, increases Fire Bolt and Lightning Bolt damage by additional 30%.
|| Very slightly eeks out more damage than {{Item List2 |id=28633 |item=Boltijin |slots=2 |simple=yes}}... if you ignore that Sloth Bible also gets 3 enchants. With enchants, should blow {{Item List2 |id=28633 |item=Boltijin |slots=2 |simple=yes}} out of the water. You can get more MATK, more ASPD, more damage to race/element/normal/boss. Take your pick. 
Weird drawback is that for some reason, Cold Bolt {{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}} isn't boosted. So for Water {{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}}, go with {{Item List2 |id=28633 |item=Boltijin |slots=2 |simple=yes}}.

||Are you a Death Note fan? Me too. Now instead of writing people's names in your Death Note you can just kill them by hitting them with it.

:Matk + 15.
:Increases magical damage against medium and large size enemies by 20%.
:[+ Mutated Khalitzburg Card]
:Reduces physical and magical damage taken from medium and large size enemies by 5%.
||Currently one of the best magic cards, due to the lack of size damage boosts magic has. Good for everything except small size.
|-

It's also used in PvM for farming Bio3 for either Big Crossbows (from Cecils) or Energy Fragments (from most weapons that drop in Bio3). Outclassed by Soul Fragment Card now, though.

:Reduces damage taken from Brute and Undead race enemies by an additional 5%.
:Bypass 50% of hard magic defense of Brute and Undead race targets when performing a magical attack.
||Against Undead race enemies (not to be confused with Undead element), you'll want to use this card in your one-handed rod and combo with {{Item List2|id=4653 |item=Nightmare Arclouse}} for the 50% MDEF pierce vs Undead. Of course, if you decide to run Wickebines, you can ignore this card and go for the racial bonus card instead. Again, on NovaRO, Dorams are people, so the damage vs Brute will not apply.

|-
||{{Item List2 |id=4473 |item=Ancient Tree Card}}
||
:Increases magical damage on Undead race targets by 10%.
||If you use a Crimson Rod and no Wickebines, you can run a Nightmare Mimic Card and this card + Nightmare Arclouse on shield for maximum anti-undead Magic. Outclassed by Soul Fragment and Colorful Teddy Bear Card, but if the enemies you're fighting are going to be multiple sizes, this can still work well.
|-

:If upgrade level is +14 or higher, additional Atk + 20 and Matk + 20.
||For Spellfist builds that cant afford Ju Card. Also, if you're using a book for a caster build, this will let you get some extra MATK without having to swap your Racial bonus cards every time.

:Adds 20% resistance to Water, Fire, Undead and Shadow property damage.
:MDEF +5
||One of the best solely defensive shields. If you're against Fire, Water, Undead, or Shadow property damage, this shield will be your best bet. Also gives a little bit of MDEF for those trying to hit 100 MDEF, or just have some MDEF handy because the MDEF scaling in this game is.... yikes. Doesn't need to be refined for bonuses.

:Increases attack speed (reduces delay after attack by 10%).
:Atk + 5%, Matk + 5%.
:Reduces damage taken from all properties by 10%.
:When receiving damage, has a low chance to recovery 50 SP per second for 5 seconds.
:When dealing physical or magical damage, has a low chance to recovery 300 HP per second for 5 seconds.
:If refine rate is 7 or higher, Atk + 20, Matk + 20.
:If refine rate is 9 or higher, ASPD + 2.
:If refine rate is 12 or higher, reduces delay after skill by 5%
||This account-bound shield is probably the strongest shield for most uses. It's straight up better than Knight's Shield/Cursed Knight's Shield in stats, and can get extremely powerful enchants. You can get up to 60% MDEF pierce towards a single race, normal, or boss monsters as an enchant, though enchanting is rather painful. It costs 2 {{Item List2|id=32417 |item=Endeavor Tokens}} and 1,000,000z per enchant, and the rate to get Boss/Normal MDEF pierce seems rather low. Good luck!

:Effects below do not function in PvP/BG/WoE
:Reflects 10% of the received short-ranged damage back to the attacker.
:Adds a 10% chance of casting Level 8 Magic Mirror (2 second duration) on the user when receiving magical attacks.
||Gives ATK/MATK and more ATK/MATK when refined, but a +7 {{Item List2 |id=28946 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}} will beat this shield at +9. If you get it to +12 for some reason, you get a free Phen Card effect (outside of PvP modes). Gives damage! Gives melee reflect and Magic Mirror outside of PvP modes too! Also custom shield sprite. I think he's cute. Some people think he's not cute. Those people are wrong.

Also reduces damage by 15% from Demon monsters. I'd say this is mostly a beginner card. Once you can get {{Item List2 |id=4354 |item=Gemini-S58 Card}} or {{Item List2 |id=32704 |item=Shining Defense Scrolls,}} swap this card out of a better defensive card like {{Item List2 |id=4609 |item=Khalitzburg Knight Card}} or {{Item List2 |id=4253 |item=Alice Card}}.

:MDEF + 10

:MHP + 15% and MSP + 5%.
||Although it doesn't seem like it's a good garment, Giant Snake Skins have up to 3 enchants that can give up to 18 stat points. That is to say, a perfect INT GSS at +9 or higher can give you 18 extra INT. These drop from Faceworm's Nest already refined and enchanted. Ideally, you'll want some kind of INT or DEX GSS, since INT will help with damage and DEX will help with cast time. Only GSS dropped by the Faceworm Queen (last boss in the instance) will have Special enchants on it, and you don't want to bother with GSS without slots or special enchants usually. Higher enchants will also let the garment elemental cards scale better, as explained below. Also combos with any Temporal Boots to give extra HP and SP.

||Similar to {{Item List2 |id=20718|item=Giant Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, Clergy's Manteau can get INT or DEX enchants, except you just get more. While GSS caps out at 18, you can get up to 24 stats total from Clergy's Manteau. The only drawback is that you have to refine it yourself (doesn't get the automatic +11 that Snake Skins tend to get) so it'll cost you more to use cards that scale with garment refine.

||At +9, will give you a nice chunk of bonuses but doesn't give hard stats like GSS enchants will. Sorcerer spells largely use INT in its formula, so having more INT will boost your damage more than the MATK from HBP. 
Keep in mind that the +7 and +9 bonuses do NOT stack. It takes the bonuses from the higher refine you have.

:For every 3 refine level, MHP + 100, MSP + 10, DEX + 3.
:When base DEX is 120 or more, Fixed Casting -0.5sec, Ranged Attack Damage + 5%.
||Probably one of the most widespread boots. When you have 120 base DEX, these boots will reduce all your fixed cast by .5 seconds. This is important because almost all of your Sorcerer spells have loads and loads of fixed cast time. Psychic wave has .6 seconds, Varetyr Spear and Earth Grave have 1 second, not to mention all the lower class skills like Land Protector, Deluge, and Dispel. This will make you cast significantly faster. For enchants, it'll depend on what build you're playing. 
For the first enchant, you can get Spell for more MATK and less variable cast time or HP% if you already have 0 variable cast and don't want damage. Spell is more commonly used. 

For the 2nd enchant, you can go {{Item List2 |id=4876 |item=Runaway Magic}} if you're doing damage, {{Item List2 |id=4880 |item=Lucky Day}} if you want to do damage without having SP drain (but less damage), or {{Item List2 |id=4878 |item=Muscular Endurance}} if you're playing support and don't need any damage boost.

=== Early to Mid-Game Support Sorcerer ===
The cheapest yet still effective Sorcerer build! Your main job will be to make sure your party doesn't die to land-based magic with LP, keep everyone's SP up with Health Conversion and Soul Change (assuming you don't have a Minstrel/Wanderer duo that can use Song of Mana), and dispel enemies with certain specific buffs so they're easier to kill. Other than that, extra things you can and might be expected to do are keep Striking on DPS classes, Endow DPS' weapons with the correct element, and use the correct Insignias. &lt;br>
'''Keep in mind that even if you're going to play some other build, this will be expected of you in almost every party that you join.'''
==== Stats ====

*'''STR''' 1-30 - If you've got any extra points, just throw them in here or in LUK. You'll need some carrying capacity to carry all your materials.
*'''AGI''' 1 - Ehhhh, you could take 100 total AGI if you want to be Sleep immune. Nice if you want some flee, also.
*'''VIT''' 100 - I'd take 100 total VIT at least, just so you don't get stunned randomly.
*'''INT''' 120 - You won't be using this for damage, but having more SP will be better for keeping up your allies' SP too. Also, reduces cast time.
*'''DEX''' 120 - If you're using Dex boots, you need 120 base DEX for the fixed cast reduction to work. If you're using Illusion Leg, it's still nice to have DEX for cast reduction. If you're opting for a VCT% build, you may leave this at 1.
*'''LUK''' 1-30 - Just throw whatever you've got left in here or in STR, gives you a little bit of random resists and perfect dodge.

If you're running instances with a boss that doesn't move much, be sure to get level 1 in the monster's element or similar (e.g. vs Root of Corruption (Earth 3), put level 1 Earth Insignia on it to make it take 50% more fire damage). In dungeons like Bio5 without static bosses, you don't need Insigs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>{{Skill List |id=2459 |skill=Summon Ventus |simple=yes}} {{Skill List |id=2456 |skill=Elemental Control |simple=yes}} - Get at least Ventus level 1, and Elemental Control level 2.

&lt;li>Any Ventus on Elemental Control level 1 will give you 1 second reduced fixed cast.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Level 1 Ventus on Level 2 Elemental Control will give you FLEE and movement speed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

==== Strategy ====

What does a Support Sorcerer do? Well, you have a couple of jobs, depending on what content you're running.
&lt;ol>&lt;li>&lt;b>Make Sure Everyone has SP&lt;/b>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Turn on '''@showsp'''. This will change everyone in your party's HP bars into their SP bars instead. Keep in mind that '''you will not be able to see their HP when showsp is on'''. Strangely enough, you can see your own HP bar though.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use the party window to target. People walk around. The names in party window don't walk around. Don't forget to shift click for Soul Change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember that Health Conversion costs 5 SP to cast. If your target is at 0 SP and then you Soul Change them, you will be at 0 SP. Make sure you have some way of getting that 5 SP so you can start generating SP again. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check the numbers in the party window. Make sure your target has &lt;b>less than half of your SP&lt;/b> before you Soul Change them. Your AB isn't going to be happy if you're stealing their SP instead of providing for them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your party has 2 Performers, they may be using Song of Mana. If they are, you probably don't have to give SP, since that skill gives a ton of SP regen. &lt;s>If you have 2 performers in your party and everyone is still running out of SP, you have my blessing to flame them.&lt;/s>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Dispel certain enemies.&lt;/b> You'll want to dispel buffed enemies that have statuses like:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Agi Up (Celia in Bio3/5, Beelzebub, Valkyrie Randgris)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hallucination Walk (Stephan in Sky Fortress)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defender (Those thorn thingies on the 2nd to last boss in ET, Randel in Bio3/5)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reflect Shield (Amdarius in OGH Hard, Randel in Bio4/5)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Max Pain (Kimi in HTF, Sorin in Bio3/5)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Magic Mirror (Fallen Bishop Hibram, Beelzebub)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And also allied Suras and other party members who ask for Dispel/Clearance&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Keep in mind that you also do not want to dispel enemies that your allies have already '''debuffed.''' Dispel will remove debuffs like Warlock's Magical Intoxication (from Comet) and Guillotine Crosses' Dark Claw. If you dispel a boss that has one of these debuffs applied to them, your allies '''can''' and '''will''' flame you.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Use Land Protector.&lt;/b> Land Protector blocks '''Ground-targeted Magic.''' That means nothing Physical or unit-targeted will be blocked. Here's some common skills that will or will not be blocked.&lt;br>
WILL BLOCK:&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Comet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Storm Gust&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Psychic Wave&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fire Wall&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meteor Storm&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pneuma&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Safety Wall&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grand Cross/Dark Grand Cross&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Earth Strain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
WILL NOT BLOCK&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Earthquake&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hell's Judgement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jack Frost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wide Stone Curse/Wide Soul Drain/Wide Sleep&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dragon Breath&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ignition Break&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arullo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Keep in mind that this is not even close to being a complete list of blocked/unblocked skills. In dungeons such as Bio5 (Tomb of the Fallen), you will be expected to keep Land Protector under the party (or under specific party members) at all times. If you have a Warlock in your bio5 party, be sure not to LP too far forward, since they cannot cast Comet on enemies on top of LP. In addition, you might want to LP over enemy pneumas so that your ranged DPS can hit them.
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Use Land-based Buffs at boss fights&lt;/b>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Land-based Buffs include Deluge, Violent Gale, Volcano, and your 4 elemental Insignias. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Deluge, Violent Gale, and Volcano&lt;/b> will boost damage of the same type. For example, if you're fighting a Water-element boss, put a Violent Gale under your party's DPS so their Wind-element damage is boosted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep in mind that these 3 skills do not work on top of other ground-based skills. For example, if you place a Safety Wall on the floor, and then cast Volcano on top of the Safety Wall, the 1 cell occupied by the Safety Wall will not have bonuses from Volcano, but the Volcano will still apply on all the other cells. Other common spells that block these ground spells are Neutral Barrier, Wall of Fog, and Pneuma.
&lt;li>&lt;b>Elemental Insignias&lt;/b> will make units take more damage from the element the insignia is weak to, and boost elemental damage of the same type. It will also restore a % of HP to units of the same element, and do damage to units of the weakened element over time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Most Common Use:&lt;/b> place a level 1 insignia of the same element on a boss (Level 1 Water Insignia on a Water-element boss), then put the element strong vs the boss on your party (Level 2 Wind Insignia on your Party if physical DPS, level 3 if magic DPS). Some Sorcerers like to cast the 2nd insignia also on top of the boss to negate the hp% healing, but usually the healing is not strong enough to be a concern. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Use Targetted Buffs&lt;/b>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This is your last priority. When everything else is done, no one needs SP, you're chilling.&lt;li>
&lt;li>Use Striking on any physical DPS in your party.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use an Endow on any Magical DPS. For example, use Wind Endow on a Chain Lightning Warlock to increase all their Wind Magic by 5%.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep in mind to Endow Physical DPS when they ask for it, and not at the very end.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

=== DPS Sorcerer ===
Alright so you've got some zeny now, nice job. You wanna do damage? Sure, but just don't forget that you're still expected to support if you're in a party.&lt;br>&lt;br>

Just as a general warning here first. If you want to build DPS Sorcerer because you heard that someone else was doing a ton of damage with it, take it with a grain of salt. There's a couple issues with damage numbers being taken as presented:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>'''What are the hitting?''' Usually these damage numbers come from Training Dummies, which are immobile and don't have much resists. In practice, monsters will move, which will make insignias much less effective if you or your tank cannot make it stay in place. Insignias have the same duration as its CD, so you won't be able to move them easily after you place them. In addition, elements and magic defense on actual monsters will affect your actual damage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>'''What buffs do they have?''' Some people use full buffs for their damage testing, which will give them higher damage numbers. See if you have access to these buffs for the content that you want to run with Sorcerer. This includes, but is not limited to:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Arch Bishop Buffs - Canto/Clem, Odin's Blessing, Expatio, Imposito Magnus, Sacrament, some especially deceitful people will show you damage involving Lex Aeterna &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performer Buffs - Bragi, Unlimited Humming Voice &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ninja Buffs - Distorted Crescent &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doram Buffs - Whatever shrimp stuff they have going on &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foods and other Consumables - +20/10 foods, MH2 Tonics if applicable, Rune Strawberry Cake, Rainbow Cake, Herb of Incantation, Fenrir Power Scroll &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
The difference between solo Sorc without insignia support and a fully supported Sorc with a nonmoving target is huge, make sure you know what's up before investing.

==== Stats ====
It's more or less the same as Support Sorcerer.
*'''STR''' 1-30 - If you've got any extra points, just throw them in here or in LUK. You'll need some carrying capacity to carry all your materials.
*'''AGI''' 1 - If you're soloing, you might want to consider getting a couple more AGI just for the FLEE chance, but I wouldn't invest too hard into it. You don't need ASPD because of all of the hard cooldowns your skills have. Take 100 total AGI if you want sleep immunity.
*'''VIT''' 1-100 - I'd take 100 '''Total''' VIT, just so you don't get stunned randomly.
*'''INT''' 120 - Gives you SP, gives you cast time, and gives you damage. Nice.
*'''DEX''' 120 - Dex Boots. You're gonna want Dex Boots (and also Sacrament from your party's AB) so you can cast at a reasonable rate. I'm not here to spend half a century trying to cast Land Protector. You've got both Variable and Fixed cast on most of your important spells. 
*'''LUK''' 1-30 - Just throw whatever you've got left in here or in STR, gives you a little bit of random resists. Some MATK too!

==== Strategy ====

=== Spellfist Sorcerer ===


==== Stats ====
(It's... different!)
*'''STR''' 1-30 - Just for carry capacity. My build I take 2 STR lol.
*'''AGI''' 120 - Definitely take 120 if you're using AGI Boots. Otherwise, you'll still need 120 to hit 193. I don't use a shield so I can hit 193 without using AGI boots/enchants.
*'''VIT''' 1-100 - As before, there's the stun thing. Also you're gonna be in melee range, so... you know. My personal build has 35.
*'''INT''' 120 - Damaj.
*'''DEX''' ~90 - Alight so this time around you actually don't want Dex Boots. If you get instacast on your bolt spells, that's honestly kind of awkward because you need to be casting Spellfist during the cast time. Take off some DEX(or stop using Hawkeye enchanted Temporal Boots I guess) if you have trouble getting in the Spellfist cast. 
*'''LUK''' 90 - idk i dumped everything else in here for damage. i guess you could move some to vit or str lol

|-
| {{Skill List |id=14 |skill=Cold Bolt |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=19 |skill=Fire Bolt |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=21 |skill=Lightning Bolt |simple=yes}}
| You get 3 elements to work with here. Which bolt you want to use affects what element damage you'll be doing. Let's say you're gonna be fighting Undead stuff. You go {{Skill List |id=19 |skill=Fire Bolt |simple=yes}}. You gonna go kill that spider in Demon God? &lt;br>Why. &lt;br>But you'll probably want to use {{Skill List |id=21 |skill=Lightning Bolt |simple=yes}}. &lt;br> If you don't get any elemental advantage at all from your 3 elements, you'll mostly likely be best off going {{Skill List |id=14 |skill=Cold Bolt |simple=yes}}. This is because you can use level 3 Elementals to increase your damage, and Aqua will increase your MATK. If you don't have enough ASPD, you can also use Ventus instead for the extra 5 ASPD and use {{Skill List |id=21 |skill=Lightning Bolt |simple=yes}}.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=279 |skill=Advanced Book |simple=yes}}
| Books are the best weapon for Spellfist, and this gives you extra damage and ASPD. The damage won't really do you any good but hey, it's 5% ASPD. If you insist on using a Rod, I guess you could ignore this.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=279 |skill=Autospell |simple=yes}}
| You'll see that I only have {{Skill List |id=279 |skill=Autospell |simple=yes}} at level 4. That's because everything above level 4 isn't Bolt skills anymore, so it'd be a waste of points. Since you'll be boosting Bolt damage with your equipment, autocasting bolts would be a decent addition to your damage. Keep in mind that your {{Skill List |id=279 |skill=Autospell |simple=yes}} bolts WILL put you on aftercast delay(CD in Mouth and other autocast gear bolts will too), and you won't be able to cast Spellfist on these bolts because they don't have a cast time.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=482 |skill=Double Casting |simple=yes}}
|This skill won't improve your Spellfist Damage, but it WILL increase your autocast bolt damage, including those from {{Skill List |id=279 |skill=Autospell |simple=yes}}.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}}
|So what you do is you cast your bolt spell. Before the cast bar finishes, you just press your {{Skill List |id=2445 |skill=Spellfist |simple=yes}} key. That will cancel your Bolt spell and empower your next couple autoattacks. These hits will Ignore FLEE, be reduced by MDEF, and be able to be blocked by Safety Wall. If they Crit, only the physical portion (the unempowered part) will be affected by crit modifiers and such.
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2457 |skill=Summon Agni |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=2458 |skill=Summon Aqua |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=2459 |skill=Summon Ventus |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=2460 |skill=Summon Tera |simple=yes}}
|Level 3 Elementals on Passive mode will let you autocast bolts of the corresponding element. They'll also give you some other nice bonuses when you have them in Passive Mode. I'd list them but honestly you might want to check out [[Seandh's Sorcerer Guide]] for them, he does a better job of explaining them than I could ever do.
|-
||{{Skill List |id=2456 |skill=Elemental Control |simple=yes}}
| You'll mostly be using level 1, to put your elemental in Passive Mode. 
|-
|{{Skill List |id=2465 |skill=Fire Insignia |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=2466 |skill=Water Insignia |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=2467 |skill=Wind Insignia |simple=yes}}&lt;br>{{Skill List |id=2468 |skill=Earth Insignia |simple=yes}}
|You'll see that I maxed out {{Skill List |id=2466 |skill=Water Insignia |simple=yes}} and took level 1 {{Skill List |id=2465 |skill=Fire Insignia |simple=yes}}. That's because I made this page with the thought of using Cold Bolt-based Spellfist. Take the level 3 Insignia of the element you want to use, and level 1 of what element is weak to your element. So if you're using Fire Bolt, you take level 3 {{Skill List |id=2465 |skill=Fire Insignia |simple=yes}} and level 1 {{Skill List |id=2468 |skill=Earth Insignia |simple=yes}}, and if you're using Lightning Bolt you take level 3 {{Skill List |id=2467 |skill=Wind Insignia |simple=yes}} and level 1 {{Skill List |id=2466 |skill=Water Insignia |simple=yes}}. Level 3 will boost Magic Damage of the corresponding element, and level 1 will make units standing inside of it take more damage from the opposite element.

=== MH2 Tank Sorcerer ===

'''THIS BUILD PROBABLY NO LONGER KEEPS AGGRO, WILL UPDATE EVENTUALLY'''

Hello, I don't play tank Sorcerer in MH2 but here's my theorycraft + input from people that actually play this for how it should go.

==== Stats ====

*'''STR''' 1-30 - Just for carry capacity. My build I take 2 STR lol.
*'''AGI''' ??? - FLEE is low in MH2 so I doubt it'll be useful, but maybe for ASPD to keep aggro?
*'''VIT''' 120 - As a tank, you'll want HP to last longer without heals, plus Max Potion will heal you more. Gold Dragon Plate Combo will also reduce more damage based on every 30 base VIT. 
*'''INT''' 120 - Cast Time
*'''DEX''' 120 - Cast Time
*'''LUK''' ??? - Dump Stat?

==== Skills ====

Keep in mind that if your MH2 party's Warlocks are weaker than your physical DPS, you can opt for the physical options instead.

=== PvP Modes Sorcerer ===
I'll start this off by saying that I'm by no means a good PvP sorcerer player, but I know what I'm supposed to be doing at least. There's many, many ways to play BG/WoE sorcerer, and I'll just be covering the way I play it and touch upon some alternate builds I've heard about.
==== Stats ====

*'''STR''' 1-60 - You have to carry a lot of random stuff, plus your lack of AGI will make you vulnerable to Chaser Masqs if you don't have enough carrying capacity.
*'''AGI''' 60+ - Agi for Chaser Masq resist. I used to run 1 AGI, now I've seen the light and run more AGI.
*'''VIT''' 120 - As a support, you want to survive as much as possible.
*'''INT''' 110 - You won't be using this for damage, but you want instacast. Depending on your gear, you can reduce this.
*'''DEX''' 120 - You'll need to swap on Dex Boots occasionally, so you need 120 here.
*'''LUK''' 1-30 - Just throw whatever you've got left in here or in STR, gives you a little bit of random resists.

==== Skills ====

==== Strategy ====

== &lt;span style="color:rgb(153,199,103); font-family: sans-serif; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black; font-size: 2rem"> Class-specific Tips&lt;/span> ==

===@showsp/Soul Change/Health Conversion===

For beginning Sorcerers, @showsp/Soul Change/Health Conversion can be confusing. Here's an example of how this works.

====@showsp====

When you turn on @showsp, your party member's HP bars turn into their SP bars. It's still green, so it's not obvious that it's been turned on. When @showsp is on, you CANNOT see your party's HP bars.

In the screencap below, the party menu on the left is @showsp OFF, and the party menu on the right is @showsp ON.

[[File:Ara-showsp.png]]



This isn't a super great example but you can notice the level 108 Rune Knight (3rd character) has 16351 HP and 656 SP and the level 111 Soul Reaper (6th character) has 10954 HP and 970 SP. The Professor (4th character) is me. The HP does NOT swap to SP for yourself.

(Also I just realized the icons are all totally wrong. Like it's showing 1st class jobs instead of 3rd class. Please ignore that, I think it's just because that's how we joined the party.)

==== Soul Change ====

First think you need to know about Soul Change is that you need to hold Shift while you click to target allies with this skill. So you press your hotkey, hold shift, and then click on your target. For some people, turning on /ns (noshift) doesn't work for this, so just... hold shift to target it.

Now how this skill works. Let's look at the above screencap again. I have 2433 Max SP (not shown). The RK has 656 SP. This means I need to have double 656 SP (1312 current SP) when I cast Soul Change to give the RK full SP. When I cast Soul Change, my current SP is replaced by half of the RK's current SP, and his SP is replaced with half of my current SP.

As an example, imagine I have 1005/1500 SP and my target has 20/800 SP. After I cast Soul Change, I will have half of the target's SP (10/1500 SP). The target will have half of my SP (500/800 SP), AFTER subtracting the 5 SP cost of Soul Change.

==== Health Conversion ====

You just use the skill and it consumes your HP and gives you SP back. This one's pretty straightforward. You use it after Soul Change to restore your SP. You may want to ask your party's healer if you have one to heal you up. 

Keep in mind that if you Soul Change someone with less than 10 SP, you're left with less than 5 SP. If you have less than 5 SP, you can't cast Health Conversion due to its SP cost.

== &lt;span style="color:rgb(153,199,103); font-family: sans-serif; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black; font-size: 2rem">Leveling&lt;/span> ==
This is just how I usually level my characters. Remember to equip the {{Item List2 |id=28608 |item=Ring of Experience |simple=yes}} from the Job Changer when you're under level 100 before it expires.

=== Lv 1 - Lv 99 ===
* '''Lv 1 - Lv 30'''
** First thing to do is either the NovaRO Tutorial if this is your first character.
** If this isn't your first character, you can go to Izlude using @go Izlude, and walk up to 127/255 to enter the Izlude Academy. Talk to the Receptionist and ask to Register for the Academy. This should boost you to Level 3/Job 10. 
** Either way, put your Skill Points into Basic Skill, then change your job to Magician. If you don't know how to change your job, use @go 50 and talk to the Job Changer at 183/186.
** Next, go down to the Basement of the Main Office. At 174/127, talk to Devon Aire and ask to join the Arc Wand Clan for the extra stats.
** Level on some weak monsters until you hit around Level 20-30. An extremely incomplete list of suggested places are:
*** 1 map south of Prontera (Porings, Little Porings, Fabre, Lunatic)
*** Ant Dungeon (Ant Eggs, don't hit the actual ants)
*** 1 map east of Geffen (Fabre, Chonchons)
* '''Lv 26 - Lv 32'''
** If you want, you can do [[Eden_Group#Level_12-25 | Instructor Boya's Eden Equipment Quest]] in Payon Cave: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Payon Cave before you start hunting Skeletons and Poporings. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member, then to Instructor Boya. You will receive your first set of Eden Equipment from Administrator Michael in the room behind the Blue Door.
** Remember that you don't need to max your Job Level to change to Sage since you will Transcend and reset later anyway. Change to Sage when you want.
* '''Lv 50 - Lv 59'''
** If you want, you can do [[Eden_Group#Level_50-59 | Instructor Boya's Eden Equipment Quest]] in Orc Dungeon: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Orc Dungeon before you start hunting Orc Zombies and Orc Skeletons. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Boya. You will receive your second set of Eden Equipment from Administrator Michael in the room behind the Blue Door.
* '''Lv 70 - 79'''
** If you want, you can do [[Eden_Group#Level_70-79 | Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest]] in Glast Heim: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Glast Heim Churchyard before you start hunting Wraiths and Evil Druids. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Ur. You will receive your third and final set of Eden Equipment from Blacksmith Thorn in the room behind the Blue Door.
** There's also normal board quests for Evil Druid and Wraith in the 71-85 board. There's no cooldown on these, so you can just do it repeatedly until you get to 85. I use this quests for after transcendence too. 
* '''Lv 85 - Lv 114'''
** Level range to join the first bracket of Gramps quests. Note that Gramps quests are rotated at the start of every month. You can also hunt them outside of Gramps map. Use the &lt;code>@whereis (monster name)&lt;/code> command to find out where a monster spawns.
** When you're still a Sage, all I usually do in gramps parties is use Fire Wall to keep things away from yourself and other support classes.
** Once you're a Professor, you can contribute to your party by typing &lt;code>@showsp&lt;/code> to see your party's SP instead of HP. Once someone's SP drops low (lower than HALF of your current SP) you can give them some SP with Soul Change. Then, use Health Conversion to restore your own SP.
** When you get to level 99, you can do one of 2 things:
*** Leave your gramps party and Transcend at the Job Changer. This will make you a Level 1/1 High Novice. You will need to get back to 85 to enter gramps again. (You can get to around 60 instantly by doing the [[Bangungot_Hospital#Part_1:_Cautious_Village|Malaya Quest]]) Finish your Gramps quest now. You should be at around level 95. Turn in 1 gramps quest to hit level 99/70. Job change to Sorcerer now. Remember to NEVER job change to Sorcerer before you Transcend first.
*** Stay 99 and finish your Gramps quests. Once you finish the quest, leave the party and Transcend at the Job Changer. Get to 1st job again, then do the [[Bangungot_Hospital#Part_1:_Cautious_Village|Malaya Quest]]. You'll get to around level 75. Job change to Professor. Turn in both gramps quests to get to 99/70. Job change to Sorcerer now. Remember to NEVER job change to Sorcerer before you Transcend first.
* '''Lv 91 - Lv 99'''
** &lt;code>Note that several quests in this board in particular give you the option of rewarding you with normal Base and Job EXP, or give zero Base EXP and twice as much Job EXP. If you think a particular build or job class may have trouble with getting Job Levels, please suggest some Lv 91-99 quests for them, and mention the double Job EXP reward option.&lt;/code>
** I like to take these quests if it has overlaps with the 85-115 Gramps quests. Sometimes Dark Priest, Rafflesia, Roween, Kaho, Neraid, and Shinobi from this board is in the Gramps map

=== Lv 100+ ===
Only instances that I think have content that will be useful will be listed here.

* '''Lv 100'''
** Minimum level to access [[Sara's Memory]].
*** You might want to try running Sara's Memory to get some cheap INT/DEX foods. Make sure to go slow if you need to, and not mob more than you can kill. If your casting time is too long, make sure to have some kind of Phen Card effect(uninterruptable casting).
* '''Lv 115 - Lv 144'''
** Level range to join the second bracket of Gramps quests. As a Sorcerer, you can use Vacuum Extreme to keep groups of mobs in place, supply SP to your party members if needed with Health Conversion/Soul Exchange, and maybe do some damage to mobs if you're a bit geared (mostly if there's any Warlock players that are leveling a sorc reading this, you can reuse some Warlock gear here I guess). For those new, I would not suggest trying to do damage in gramps at this point or at any point without having to invest heavily.
* '''Lv 120'''
** Minimum level to access [[Ghost Palace]].
***Thanatos Staff (the one-handed one) from Ghost Palace is a very respectable starter weapon, if you want to pick it up. You will probably want to bring some uninterruptable casting effect here since there are some ranged monsters. Watch out in the Zombie floor to not get mobbed, and make sure the whole room is clear before you move on.
* '''Lv 125'''
** Minimum level to access [[Airship Assault]].
* '''Lv 130'''
** Minimum level to access [[Old Glast Heim]], [[Charleston Crisis]]
***Old Glast Heim, both normal and hard, will be nice to craft Temporal Boots if you opt for using those boots. If you can find a party, start running it as soon as you can. I believe you also get a little bit of EXP from it, but since the exp-share level gap is only 30, you will not get any monster EXP if there are any party members at level 200. Might be some completion EXP? Don't worry about being too weak, if you make sure no one runs out of SP, try your best not to die (don't run off by yourself), and keep Striking up on any physical DPS, usually no one will really care what your gear is. (This is actually true for most large-party instances)
***Charleston Crisis gives nice instance-completion EXP, so joining a party when you can is nice. 
* '''Lv 145 - Lv 175'''
** Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests. Gramps will be more or less the same at every bracket.
* '''Lv 160'''
** Minimum level to access [[Bios Island]], [[Morse Cave]], [[Temple of the Demon God]], [[Monster Hunter]], and [[Illusion of Luanda]]. 
*** Do prereqs for Bios Island/Morse Cave/Temple of the Demon God (usually called BMD for all 3 instances together, in recruitment chats) as soon as you can, since these 3 instances need to be done in this order once and sometimes show up in the weekly instance quest rotation. It's much nicer to already have the quest complete than rush to finish it when it shows up. Also, Bios and Morse drop Prize of Hero, which has a chance to drop Hero Magic Coat, which is a really convenient way to get uninterruptable cast. 
*** Monster Hunter 1 (also known as Low Rank hunts) needs to be done a couple times to get a set of Low Rank Shadow Gear. I recommend getting the DEX set (Tendrillion bosses) if you can get a party for it. Otherwise, any shadow set from MH1 is fine as long as you get 4 pieces. You'll need to fill all 4 Shadow Gear slots as a prerequisite to join Monster Hunter 2 hunts.
*** Illusion of Luanda has some item turn-in quests that can be done once per day. If you can get your hands on some Token of Wootan or Token of Megalith (dropped by all the mobs in this dungeon, some players might also sell these?) you can turn in 3 of each per day for a very respectable amount of EXP.
* '''Lv 175'''
** Minimum level to take [[Weekly Quests]], enter [[High Rank Hunts|Monster Hunter 2]], [[Magma Dungeon F3]], [[Abyss Glast Heim]]
*** Start taking Weekly Quests (from the Dailies NPC in the Main Office) as soon as you can. Try to do as many of the weekly quests as you can, and don't be discouraged if there's any of them that you can't complete. They're aimed at mid to endgame players, and tend to change depending on current Events.
*** Although MH2 is now unlocked, I don't really recommend doing this until you have the gear. Sorcerer is usually used in the Tank or Utility role. 
**** If you opt for playing Tank, I have a short gear/skill guide [[#MH2_Tank_Sorcerer|here]]. You can use Nysori gear for Nyia, and Garronath gear for Garranth. Nyia/Garranth are much easier than their larger counterparts, so if you are beginning to gear for tank, you should be able to tank these. Tank Sorcerer enables higher damage than other tanks such as Minstrel and Royal Guard, but is not as good when your party is lesser geared, since they may need the extra ACD from Minstrel's Bragi.
**** If you opt for playing Utility, you really don't need any gear except some sort of Phen Card effect for uninterruptable cast. Although this is much cheaper, this does mean you have to find a party that is looking for a utility character, which tends to be much rarer.
*** Magma 3 and Abyss Glast Heim are dungeons released when the level cap expanded from 175 to 185, designed to give EXP mostly for this level range. You will probably need a party for these, you can treat them like a harder Gramps party.
**** Although the 175-200 Gramps is unlocked now, I'm unsure how much EXP it gives compared to Mag3 and AGH. I believe it gives less, and most of the EXP is from the monsters killed, rather than the quest turn-in. Gramps is nice to do if you can't find any parties for the other 2 though.
* '''Lv 180'''
** Minimum level to enter [[Einbech Dungeon 3]], [[Odin's Temple 4 / Odin's Past|Odin's Temple 4]]
*** These 2 dungeons were released when the level cap expanded from 185 to 200. If you look in the ingame #lfg channel, sometimes players offer a leech for these dungeons. This is because of a special squad loot bonus on these maps where you get the most loot for running small parties of around 3. How these leech parties usually work is that the person offering the leech will find 2-3 other players that need EXP and bring them along while they farm the dungeon, using Giant Flywings (work similarly to flywings but will transport the entire party if used by the party leader). Since the dungeons are good for EXP, the 2-3 other players will get EXP and loot while the main player farms. The leeched players can afk and go do something else during this. At the end, the leeched players give the loot over to the main player as payment for the EXP. Recommended to not scam the farming player, they have to pay for the Giant Flywing and all.
*** Not to be confused with MH2 leeches, where a player pays a party of 3-4 to bring them while the party completes 2* hunts (Nysori/Garronath) so that the paying player can complete weeklies.
* '''Lv 190'''
** Minimum Level to enter [[Abyss Dungeon 4]]
*** This dungeon was released with Einbech3 and Odin 4, when the level cap expanded from 185 to 200. See the Lv 180 section, same leech concept.
