[[File:Archbishop Art Alternative.jpg|frame]]

Due to the length of [[Reno's Full Support Arch Bishop Guide]], the alternative AB build is separated into its own section. Here I will discuss Exorcist Arch Bishops, a.k.a. Holy Magic Caster. I refer to it as "XO AB" for short.

Although it says “Guide” on the title, a lot of the contents are based on my personal experience and observations; it’s partially a report/compilation of test results as well. I encourage you to use this guide as a starting point to find what skills and equipment setup works best for you.

== Briefing ==
Arch Bishop is one of the four player-controlled characters (the other being Royal Guard, Expanded Super Novice, and Homunculus S Bayeri) capable of learning and using '''Holy''' element offensive skills in Ragnarok Online (excluding player-controlled characters that can equip Holy-element ammo). Offensively, Holy element is best used against '''Shadow''' and '''Undead''' element enemies, and it is also strong against '''Poison''' Lv 3 and 4.

Exorcist Arch Bishop is a very specialized type of killer, whose targets are very clearly defined as '''Undead''' and '''Shadow''' element monsters, and '''Demon''' race monsters. Their general modus operandi is to reduce the enemy’s resistance to Holy element first, then buff themselves to maximize the damage of their Holy element spells. 

If you have played a Guillotine Cross or seen someone play one before, you've probably seen them use {{Skill List |id=2021 |skill=Venom Impress |simple=yes}} followed by {{Skill List |id=378 |skill=Enchant Deadly Poison |simple=yes}} and/or {{Skill List |id=5001 |skill=Dark Claw |simple=yes}} to increase their damage. Arch Bishop is similar, difference being they're MATK-reliant, Holy element spell casters. They have a lot of buff and self-buff skills, and several debuff skills such as {{Skill List |id=78 |skill=Lex Aeterna |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2046 |skill=Oratio |simple=yes}} that helps them deal more damage with their Holy element spells, allowing them to play multiple roles in a party; as a healer, support/buffer, debuffer, the occasional tank, and of course, damage dealer.

It is important to note that almost all of the Priest class’ essential Exorcist skills require and consume '''Blue Gemstones'''. This includes Resurrection, Safety Wall, Sanctuary, Magnus Exorcismus, and Adoramus. Additionally, Exorcist Arch Bishops require specific gears to work well, and these gears are rarely sold by players in the Market. Due to these reasons, '''it is not recommended to create an Exorcist Arch Bishop as your first character''', as a new player will struggle with the upkeep.

=== ''But why Exorcist instead of Full Support?'' ===
The short answer is; with Exorcist build you can resurrect and protect &lt;u>but you can also attack&lt;/u>.

Also because I think it's a logical progression (perhaps one of many possible progressions) from playing as healer/defensive support, and a way of adjusting to recent changes in the game. Consider that:
* HP and SP leeching gears (Thanatos weapons from [[Ghost Palace]], Rideword Hat, etc) and pets like Incubus/Succubus are relatively easy to obtain, and widely used by physical job class while farming, leveling, and instance raiding. It makes them less reliant on potions and healing skills. 
* Recently-implemented instance dungeons, maps, and other content are populated by Shadow and/or Undead element enemies, and Demon race enemies. 
* The addition of Doram/Summoner job class opens up new ways to play the role of tank and defensive support, which directly (and indirectly) makes a healer's job easier to do.

It's a brave new world full of nasty demons and rotten zombies. You can shoot Jesus Bolts and the Holy Disco Party don't start till you walk in. Now is the time for exorcists to shine.

=== ''Can I farm with an Exorcist Arch Bishop?'' ===
I get asked this question occasionally and the short answer to it is "'''Effectively, you can. Efficiently, only in certain places and with specific items/equipment.'''" 

Due to the nature of their main offensive skills (single-target Holy element magic and AoE Damage-over-Time Holy element magic that only works on specific types of monsters), there are a few places where Exorcist Arch Bishops can effectively ''and'' efficiently farm. Nifflheim fields, Cursed Abbey dungeon, Nightmare Glast Heim, Ghost Palace, and Invaded Prontera (see [[Banquet for Heroes]] and [[Room of Consciousness]]) are some of them. 

You can take advantage of cards such as {{Card |id=4187 Raydric Archer Card |simple=yes}} to farm {{Item List |id=12030 |item=Box of Resentment |simple=yes}} from Demon race monsters. Additionally you can use {{Card |id=4190 Wraith Card |simple=yes}} to farm {{Item List |id=12027 |item=Giggling Box |simple=yes}} from Undead race monsters, such as [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/2481/wraith-dead-nightmare Nightmare Wraith Dead] and farm [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Potion_Creation Fabric] on the side. See this [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Card_Reference#Item-dropping list of cards] for more farming ideas.

Properly geared and amply prepared, it is possible for Exorcist Arch Bishop to solo instances such as [[Old Glast Heim]], Hazy Forest, [[Room of Consciousness]], [[Sky Fortress]], and [[Geffen Magic Tournament]] (click here to read [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/User:Renata#Running_GMT_as_Battle-Exorcist_Bishop a mini guide on how to run GMT as an AB]). For dungeons that can be entered with a party, two or more Exorcist Arch Bishops can work together to benefit each other. Alternating between casting Adoramus, Lex Aeterna, and Oratio between each other is one way to do it. '''Adoramus will not consume Blue Gemstones if the caster stands next to another Acolyte class character'''.

Bottom line, Exorcist Arch Bishops are not gonna be as flashy or fast as other physical- and magic-based classes when it comes to farming and dealing damage. On the other hand, they have their own niche, as a multi-functional and flexible class. The only thing they can't really damage with their spells are Holy element enemies, and they should watch out for enemies that can reflect magic. Everything else is fair game for an Exorcist, given enough time. The key to enjoying Exorcist Arch Bishop is to acknowledge their skills' restrictions, and work with them instead of against them. Being able to balance damage-dealing and supporting will make you a valuable, irreplaceable member in any party and any guild.

|&lt;nowiki>+7&lt;/nowiki>
|&lt;nowiki>+2&lt;/nowiki>
|}

Similar to magic-casters such as Warlock and Sorcerer, Exorcist Arch Bishop’s main stats are '''INT''' and '''DEX'''; INT to increase their '''Magic Attack''' and overall damage dealt from their Holy magic skills, and '''DEX''' in order to '''minimize Variable Cast Time'''.

* '''INT''': Higher INT increases your MATK, soft MDEF, MaxSP, natural SP regeneration, effectiveness of SP recovery items, resistance against status debuffs such as Silence, and reduces Variable Cast Time. Getting as many INT as possible is preferred, as it will give you more MATK bonus from {{Card |id=4596 Antique Book Card}}, just do not go over 120 INT, as it would be a waste of stat points.
** You need 110 INT to get the MATK bonus from {{Item List |id=2924 |item=INT Glove |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (purchasable in [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eclage#Eclage_Glove Eclage]).
** You need 120 INT to get the MATK bonus from {{Item List |id=22009 |item=Temporal INT Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. See [[Temporal Boots]].

* '''DEX''': Higher DEX reduces your Variable Cast Time at twice the effectiveness of INT. Variable Cast Time is eliminated when you have (DEX x 2) + (INT) = 530, and you can see how much Variable Cast Time reduction you have using the &lt;code>@battlestats&lt;/code> command in-game. This is mainly to reduce the Variable Cast Time of skills such as {{Skill List |id=79 |skill=Magnus Exorcismus |simple=yes}}, however you still need {{Skill List |id=2515 |skill=Sacrament |simple=yes}} in order to reduce Fixed Cast Time. As with the case with INT, do not go over 120 DEX.
** You need 120 DEX for the Fixed Cast Time reduction from {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal DEX Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} to apply.
** Note that INT and DEX do not reduce After Cast Delay (global cooldown) and Skill Cooldown. After Cast Delay can be reduced when you're under the effect of Bard class skill {{Skill List |id=321 |skill=Poem of Bragi |simple=yes}}, and if you equip certain equipment such as {{Item List |id=1635 |item=Speedy Recovery Wand |simple=yes}}. Some equipment such as {{Item List |id=1586 |item=+6 Vellum Bible |simple=yes}} reduces Skill Cooldown of certain skills. For more equipment that reduce After Cast Delay and Skill Cooldown, [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Reno%27s_Full_Support_Arch_Bishop_Guide#Cast_Delay_and_Cooldown_Reduction_for_Priest_class click here].

* '''LUK''': When it becomes too costly to increase INT and DEX, consider getting some LUK, as it adds some MATK and Perfect Dodge, plus minor resistance against status debuffs. LUK is also essential to increase the success chance of {{Skill List |id=77 |skill=Turn Undead |simple=yes}}. Aim for (Base LUK) + (LUK from Job Bonus) = multiples of 3. See the following examples to help determine how much LUK you should get:
** 13 Base LUK + 2 LUK (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 30 LUK (from {{Skill List |id=75 |skill=Gloria |simple=yes}}) = 45 LUK
** 19 Base LUK + 2 LUK (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 30 LUK (from {{Skill List |id=75 |skill=Gloria |simple=yes}}) - 6 LUK (from {{Item List |id=1669 |item=Thanatos Staff |slots=1 |simple=yes}}) = 45 LUK
** 20 Base LUK + 2 LUK (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 30 LUK (from {{Skill List |id=75 |skill=Gloria |simple=yes}}) + 8 LUK (from {{Skill List |id=2048 |skill=Lauda Ramus Lv 4 |simple=yes}}) = 60 LUK.

* '''VIT''': You'll need this to increase your MaxHP and resistance against status debuffs. As a rule of thumb it’s a good idea to get (Base VIT) + (VIT from Job Bonus) = 100 VIT for Stun immunity. See the following examples to determine how much VIT you should get:
** 85 Base VIT + 7 VIT (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 8 VIT (from {{Skill List |id=2047 |skill=Lauda Agnus Lv 4 |simple=yes}}) = 100 VIT
** 87 Base VIT + 7 VIT (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 6 VIT (from {{Item List |id=1669 |item=Thanatos Staff |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. See [[Ghost Palace]]) = 100 VIT
** 88 Base VIT + 7 VIT (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 5 VIT (from [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter#Sturdy_Shadow_Set_.28VIT.29 VIT Shadow Gear Set]) = 100 VIT
** 93 Base VIT + 7 VIT (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) = 100 VIT
** 90 or 108 Base VIT if you're planning to wear an Armor with {{Card |id=4392 Dame of Sentinel Card}}, in order to gain the DEX bonus from the card.

* '''AGI''': Higher AGI increases your Flee and ASPD, and higher ASPD makes your character's casting animation to finish slightly faster. That doesn't mean AGI will reduce your cast time; more like, it will help you spam skills faster. This stat also offers resistance against [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Status_Effects#Sleep Sleep], and helps with resisting and reducing the duration of Shadow Chaser class' [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Masquerade-Weakness Masquerade] skills. See the following examples to determine how much AGI you should get.
** 77 Base AGI + 5 AGI (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 18 AGI (from {{Skill List |id=2042 |skill=Canto Candidus Lv 3 |simple=yes}} cast by an Arch Bishop at Job Lv 60) = 100 AGI.
** 83 Base AGI + 5 AGI (from Job Lv 60 Bonus) + 12 AGI (from {{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Increase Agility Lv 10 |simple=yes}}) = 100 AGI
** Note that Canto Candidus will always overwrite Increase Agility, so the AGI bonus will not stack.
* '''STR''': This is mainly to increase your Weight Limit, so that you can carry more healing items, skill catalysts, spare equipment, and have some resistance against Shadow Chaser class' Masquerade skills. Alternatively you can also increase your Weight Limit using Gym Passes, obtainable from the [[Cash Shop]] or by spending your [[Gold Coins]] at the Mysterious Slot Machine.

== Skills ==
=== Quick Build References ===
'''Acolyte/High Acolyte'''

At this stage, you should focus on getting the pre-requisite skills and skills that will be used frequently for leveling, particularly Heal and Increase Agility Lv 10. Maximizing Heal, Blessing, and Increase Agility are important, as Highness Heal and Coluceo Heal will depend on the highest learned level of Heal, and both Clementia and Canto Candidus will use the highest learned level of Blessing and Increase Agility.

[[File:AB Exo Skill Aco.PNG|center]]

Acolyte skills:
* Heal Lv 10, Blessing Lv 10, Increase Agility Lv 10.
* Ruwach Lv 1, Teleport Lv 2, Warp Portal Lv 4, Pneuma Lv 1.
* Divine Protection Lv 5 (pre-requisite for Blessing).
* Aqua Benedicta Lv 1, Angelus Lv 2 (pre-requisite for Priest skills).
* Decrease Agility Lv 3 (left over skill points).

==== Healer with a sidearm (Judex) ====
[https://i.gyazo.com/d6d85ba1ba51ba60230aa4419ddcfd6c.mp4 See Judex in action here.]

Perhaps you're warming up to the idea of holding the power over life ''and death'' in both hands but you want to get better at healing before you tackle multi tasking. So while you do that, consider getting Judex. You can use it as a sidearm to fend off stragglers while you're leveling or raiding dungeons/instances with your party.

[[File:AB Exo Skil Judex.PNG|center]]

Judex doesn't deal crazy awesome damage but it is spammable and can be insta-cast (requires INT + (DEX x 2) = 530. Check your Variable Cast Time reduction with &lt;code>@battlestats&lt;/code> command in-game). It's a good idea to combine Judex with Decrease Agility to slow down enemies like &lt;s>Guy Who Died of Caffeine Overdose&lt;/s> Nightmare Wanderer from approaching you. The only pre-requisite for Judex is Turn Undead Lv 1, so this build is not drastically different from most Full Support builds. This build has 15 skill points remaining for you to distribute to other skills.

==== Healer-Adoramus Hybrid ====
[https://i.gyazo.com/32c7a3bb6708d0d0410d0ec3d1407bf3.mp4 See Adoramus in action here.]

While Judex is nice to fend off low level stragglers, you can use &lt;s>Jesus Bolts&lt;/s> Adoramus to weaken and even destroy enemies. If you have Judgement set, you can use this build to level up on your own, from Lv 100 to 145-ish. In other words, this build won't be entirely dependent on Gramps parties to level up.

[[File:AB Exo Skill Ado Judex.PNG|center]]

You will be super effective against Shadow and Undead element enemies with low MDEF and/or frequently buff themselves with Agi Up and/or Stone Skin. However, you should avoid enemies that buff themselves with Magic Mirror, and you'll have a hard time against enemies that use Hallucination Walk.

This build shines in instances such as [[Old Glast Heim]] and [[Bios Island]], and against enemies such as Black Celestial Tendrillion in [[Monster Hunter]]. Also, try to stick as close as possible to other ABs in your party; Adoramus will not consume Blue Gemstones if you stand next to an Acolyte class character while casting it. Considering the cast time of Adoramus is purely variable (2 seconds), you can eliminate its cast time by stacking more INT and DEX from stats, buffs, stat food items, and equipment.

==== The Exorcist (Magnus Exorcismus + Adoramus) ====
[https://i.gyazo.com/dcd77b7a658fe6d2d48de0f99d3cd0fe.mp4 See Magnus Exorcismus in action here.]

This &lt;s>Holy Disco Party&lt;/s> build is for those who want to go nuclear on Demons and Undeads that populate instances such as [[Morse Cave]], [[Temple of the Demon God]], [[Room of Consciousness]], [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]], [[Last Room]], and [[Charleston Crisis]]. Additionally, this build can be particularly helpful against the final boss in [[Sky Fortress]].

Besides ME and Adoramus, Sanctuary is also part of their offensive skill rotation when fighting Demon race and Undead element monsters. Be warned that this build is gonna need ''a lot'' of Blue Gemstones to maintain. Having a headgear with Mistress Card may make it easier but since that's beyond the budget of most players, stay close to the other AB in your party; this way, Adoramus will not consume Blue Gemstones. Getting Gym Passes would be very helpful, as it would allow you to carry more ammo and other supplies.

[[File:AB Exo Skill Ado ME Judex.PNG|center]]

An important issue for this particular build is gears. You may have to bring two (or more) sets of gears and swap them according to which skill you're going to use. Alternatively you could wear Judgement set pieces (armor, weapon, garment, footgear) for Adoramus damage, and combine them with gears for increasing ME damage (Shrine Maiden Ribbon and Spiritual Ring accessory set).

If you are using the Beta client, you'll be able to use the Gear Swap feature to quickly swap between equipment sets with a click of a button, or with Alt + D. Note that there is a 10-second cooldown before you can use Gear Swap again.

[[File:ABgearswap.gif|center]]

After wearing your equipment normally, click the Swap Equip button in the equipment window (Alt + Q) to display the Swap Equip window. Place the gears you want to swap with in the Swap Equip window. Gears that you've placed in the Swap Equip window will have "swap arrow" icons on top of them in your Inventory window (Alt + E).

&lt;u>Currently the Beta client is no longer supported due to instabilities&lt;/u>. If you still want to give it a shot, there are players that still use Beta client and may be willing to give you a copy. Perhaps the best way to do this is to ask around in NovaRO forums or in NovaRO Discord.

=== Skill Information ===
You’re probably already familiar with using Acolyte and Priest class skills to heal, support, and defend. So here we’ll look at some of their skills from another perspective, which is to weaken and deal damage on Demon race, and Undead and Shadow element monsters. For more details on recovery and supportive skills, please refer to [[Reno's Full Support Arch Bishop Guide]].

First of all, let's take a look at how AoE skills work in Ragnarok Online. You probably have noticed that skill information in-game and from other sources describing the skill's AoE in numbers like 7x7, 11x11 but you're not really sure how large of an AoE it is, and how it's measured. Now, take a look at the simple illustration below.

[[File:AoE guide.PNG|center]]

For example, Pneuma has a 3x3 AoE; what this means is that it has an area of effect of (3 x 3) 9 cells, arranged in a square. Coluceo Heal Lv 2 has 15x15 AoE centered on the caster. It has an area of effect of (15 x 15) 225 cells, with the caster occupying the center cell. Coluceo Heal will affect party members standing in cells extending (15 - 1 = 14/2 = 7) 7 cells to the left, right, front, and rear of the caster.

Most AoE skills in Ragnarok Online are typically arranged in a square just like the illustration above, although there are AoE skills with unusual/exotic arrangement. Sanctuary and Magnus Exorcismus are some examples of AoE skills with unusual arrangement, being shaped like a cross. It will require some practice to be able to quickly target AoE skills accurately, and understanding how AoE skills work is just the first step.

==== Acolyte Skills ====
At this stage Heal is practically your one and only leveling skill, and you can only use it on Undead element monsters. You will also use it to level as a Priest and High Priest. Take this time to learn to differentiate between Undead element and Undead race. A handful of Undead race monsters are not Undead element (e.g. Pitman (Undead race, Earth element), Dolor of Thanatos (Undead race, Ghost element)), and therefore cannot be damaged using skills like Heal, Sanctuary, Magnus Exorcismus, etc.

| style="text-align: center;" | 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Damage/recovery, single target
| If /noshift is activated, deals Holy element magic damage on Undead element enemies. Damage dealt depends on skill level, and caster's INT and MATK. Deals more damage when equipping {{Item List |id=2677 |item=Spiritual Ring |simple=yes}} combo (with {{Item List |id=2607 |item=Clip |slots=1 |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=2608 |item=Rosary |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=2626 |item=Rosary |slots=1 |simple=yes}}). 
If you're wearing {{Item List |id=5225 |item=Parade Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (see [[Cash Shop]], Military Headgear Box), casting Heal on an enemy will trigger autocast Lex Aeterna on the same enemy. Note that Parade Hat works while you're still an Acolyte/High Acolyte but will not work when you job change into Monk/Champion/Sura.

Heal can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=2545 |item=Musika |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (autocast on self), or {{Card |id=4284 Chepet Card}} (autocast on enemy).
|-

| style="text-align: center;" | Damage, single target
| (Quest skill. Talk to Platinum Skill NPC in [[Main Office]] to learn this skill) Deals Holy element magic damage on any enemy, as long as the enemy is not Holy element. Also removes Kyrie Eleison from a player. Deals more damage when the caster is under the effect of {{Skill List |id=454 |skill=Priest Spirit |simple=yes}}.

| Reveals hidden enemies within 5x5 area centered around the caster, and deals low Holy element magic damage on them.
Ruwach is generally used when you need to chase enemies that use Cloaking or Hiding, and to prevent them from sneaking up on you.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=25 |skill=Pneuma |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 1

| Creates a 3x3 barrier that blocks ranged physical damage for 10 seconds. Cannot be cast near each other. Cannot be cast near or on top of Safety Wall. Cannot be cast on top of skills like Land Protector.
This is an absolutely vital defensive skill that will remain useful in end-game content and in competitive scenarios.

Pneuma can be autocast when equipping {{Card |id=4349 Errende Ebecee Card}}.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=30 |skill=Decrease Agility |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 0 ~ 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Debuff, single target
| Temporarily reduces AGI and movement speed of players and normal monsters. Skill level, caster's INT, and target's MDEF affects success chance. This is especially helpful to slow down enemies with high movement speed and ASPD, and making it harder for them to break through your Kyrie Eleison/Safety Wall. [https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/bug-tracker/fixed-bugs/decrease-agility-incorrectly-including-base-level-into-chance-calculation-potentially-r103/ See here for details].

Decrease Agility can be autocast when equipping {{Card |id=4395 Maero of Thanatos Card}}.

| style="text-align: center;" | 0 ~ 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Debuff, caster-centered, screenwide
| Reduces the physical defense of all Demon race and Undead element monsters. Skill level, caster's base level, and the enemies' level affects success chance. Generally only helpful for physical attackers, and relatively useless for magic users. Please see [http://irowiki.org/wiki/DEF how Defense in Renewal works] for more details.

Signum Crucis can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=1541 |item=Nemesis |simple=yes}} or {{Card |id=4248 Ancient Mummy Card}}.

==== Priest Skills ====
As a Priest, you have alternative ways to deal damage aside from Heal-bombing but you’ll have to start carrying Blue Gemstones, and get Gym Passes (see [[Gold Coins]], Mysterious Slot Machine in [[Automated Events]], and [[Cash Shop]]) to increase your Weight Limit and carry as many Gemstones as you possibly can. Many gears that increase your skills’ damage and reduce the cast time may be level-locked while you’re still a Priest/High Priest. If you're just starting out, it's perfectly fine to continue Heal-bombing and to use Turn Undead to hunt Undead element monsters.

On the other hand, if you have the gears for Magnus Exorcismus and/or a friend to help you tank monsters, you can start hunting Demon race monsters alongside Undead element monsters. A lot of Demon race monsters are also Shadow/Dark element, making them vulnerable against Magnus Exorcismus and Sanctuary. You can also use Magnus Exorcismus and Sanctuary on a Demon race monster that is not Shadow/Dark element such as Harpy (Demon/Wind), Demon Pungus (Demon/Poison), Medusa (Demon/Neutral), Ferre (Demon/Water and Demon/Earth), etc.

| style="text-align: center;" | Damage Over Time, ground targeting, AoE
| Consume 1 {{Item List |id=717 |item=Blue Gemstone |simple=yes}} to create a cross-shaped 7x7 AoE that deals Holy element magic damage on Demon race and Undead element monsters. This skill deals no damage on any other monster race/element. This skill will continue to deal damage if the caster dies after successfully casting it. It will stop dealing damage if the caster is debuffed (e.g. Stunned, Frozen, Stone Cursed). Cannot be cast on top of skills like Land Protector.
The damage is increased when equipping {{Item List |id=18791 |item=Shrine Maiden Ribbon |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=1631 |item=Holy Stick |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=2129 |item=Exorcism Bible |simple=yes}} combo, and {{Item List |id=2677 |item=Spiritual Ring |simple=yes}} combo.

| Consume 1 {{Item List |id=717 |item=Blue Gemstone |simple=yes}} to create a cross-shaped 5x5 AoE that deals fixed Holy element magic damage on Demon race and Undead element normal monsters. Normal monsters will be knocked back but Boss Monsters will not. This skill deals no damage on any other monster race/element and will heal them instead. Cannot be cast on top of skills like Land Protector.
The damage is increased when equipping {{Item List |id=2677 |item=Spiritual Ring |simple=yes}} combo. It deals max damage at Lv 7, and increasing the skill level will only increase the skill duration and number of targets it will hit.

Sanctuary can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=2990 |item=Pendant of Harmony |simple=yes}}.

This can be used as a pre-cast to Magnus Exorcismus, or to trigger effects such as {{Item List |id=4876 |item=Reckless Magic |simple=yes}} (see [[Temporal Boots]]), {{Item List |id=5464 |item=Zaha Doll Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, {{Item List |id=5360 |item=Wickebine's Black Cat Ears |simple=yes}}, etc. Cannot be cast on top of skills like Land Protector.

| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=77 |skill=Turn Undead |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 3 or 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Damage, single target
| Deals Holy element magic damage on a target, and has a chance to instantly kill Undead element normal monsters. The chances of insta-kill is capped at 70%. [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Turn_Undead Chances of insta-kill] is increased by higher skill level (+2% at Lv 1, +20% at Lv 10), base level (about +1% every 10 base levels), total INT (about +1% every 10 INT), total LUK (about +1% every 10 LUK), and if your target has less HP remaining (about +1% every 5% HP lost). Turn Undead is more likely to insta-kill an Undead element monster if it's low on health. This skill has 3 second After Cast Delay.

Turn Undead can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=1528 |item=Grand Cross |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=16029 |item=Noble Cross |simple=yes}}. See [[Horror Toy Factory]].
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=54 |skill=Resurrection |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 4
| style="text-align: center;" | Damage/recovery, single target
| Consume 1 {{Item List |id=717 |item=Blue Gemstone |simple=yes}} to deal Holy element magic damage on a target, and has a chance to instantly kill Undead element normal monsters. It works similarly to Turn Undead of the same level. At Lv 4, this skill has 3 second After Cast Delay.
This skill and Turn Undead are very useful against Renovated Amdarais in [[Room of Consciousness]]. See [[Banquet for Heroes]].
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=68 |skill=Aspersio |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 4 ~ 5

|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=73 |skill=Kyrie Eleison |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 4, 6, 8, or 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Defensive, single target
| Applies a barrier on a target that protects it from physical damage, and prevents flinching caused by physical attacks for a set duration, or until the barrier blocks the maximum amount of hits, or until the barrier receives damage that exceeds its durability. Even skill levels increase the number of hits blocked. At Lv 10 it blocks 10 hits and has 30% of the target's MaxHP as the barrier's durability.
Kyrie Eleison can not be stacked with Assumptio. Kyrie Eleison will not protect a target from magical damage, and cannot prevent flinching caused by magical attacks.

Kyrie Eleison can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=15095 |item=Hero Judgement Shawl |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Arch Bishop and Sura only) or {{Card |id=4236 Amon Ra Card}}.

It's still a good idea to keep Kyrie Eleison on your hotkeys even after you've learned Praefatio, since Kyrie can be quickly cast and easily spammed while Praefatio is still on cooldown.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=12 |skill=Safety Wall |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Defensive, ground targeting
| Consume 1 Blue Gemstone to create a 1 cell barrier on the ground that blocks all melee physical attacks. Higher skill level reduces its cast time, and increases the SP cost, durability, maximum number of hits blocked (up to 11 hits at Lv 10), and duration. Its durability depends on the caster's INT and MaxSP. It will not block ranged physical attacks and magic attacks.
Safety Wall cannot be cast near or on top of Pneuma. Cannot be cast on top of skills like Land Protector.

If the first hit that Safety Wall received exceeds its maximum durability, it will disappear immediately. You have to continuously spam Safety Wall when tanking monsters/Boss monsters with high ASPD and/or deals very high damage.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=78 |skill=Lex Aeterna |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 1
| style="text-align: center;" | Debuff, single target
| A target will receive doubled damage from the next attack/magic spell that hits it. This can't be cast on a Frozen or Stone Cursed target. Has 3 second After Cast Delay. 

Lex Aeterna can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=15095 |item=Hero Judgement Shawl |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Arch Bishop and Sura only) and {{Item List |id=5225 |item=Parade Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Acolyte class and Priest-based class only).
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=72 |skill=Status Recovery |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 1
| style="text-align: center;" | Debuff/recovery, single target
| Inflicts Blind on Undead element monsters. Returns an aggro-ed monster back to its passive state (does not work on naturally aggressive monsters). Removes {{Skill List |id=2209 |skill=Stasis |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2201 |skill=White Imprison |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2419 |skill=Poem of Netherworld |simple=yes}} from a target.
Status Recovery is enabled when equipping {{Card |id=27120 Iara Card}}.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=76 |skill=Lex Divina |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 5 ~ 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Debuff/recovery, single target
| Has a chance to inflict Silence on a target. Higher level reduces the SP cost and increases the Silence duration. Using this skill on a Silenced target will remove the debuff from them. Targets with low INT, VIT, and LUK are more likely to be Silenced, and will take longer to recover from it. This skill will not work on Boss monsters.
Lex Divina can be autocast when equipping {{Card |id=4364 Margaretha Sorin Card}}.
|}

==== High Priest Skills ====
Baby Arch Bishop and non-Transcendent Arch Bishop will not be able to learn these skills. With that said, Transcendent skills for Priest class are not incredibly vital for Exorcist build. Arguably, Meditatio is still useful for Heal-bombing on early levels and SP regeneration on higher levels.

| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=361 |skill=Assumptio |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 3 ~ 5
| style="text-align: center;" | Defensive, single target
| Doubles the target's Hard DEF and Hard MDEF. Higher skill level increases the cast time, After Cast Delay, duration, and SP cost. Assumptio cannot be stacked with Kyrie Eleison.
It is best used on tanks with high Hard Def (e.g. Royal Guard), and for resisting physical and magical attacks that can't be easily dodged or blocked (e.g. Water Ball). This skill does not prevent flinching when you're being hit by physical and magical attacks.

Assumptio can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=2679 |item=Ring of Resonance |simple=yes}} or {{Card |id=4363 High Priest Card}}.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=363 |skill=Meditatio |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 5 ~ 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Passive, self buff
| Permanently increases MaxSP, SP regeneration, and amount of HP recovered by Heal.
If you're a High Priest leveling by Heal-bombing, it's best to maximize this skill.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=362 |skill=Basilica |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 0 ~ 5
| style="text-align: center;" | Defensive, caster-centered, ground targeting
| Consume 1 Holy Water, 1 Blue Gemstone, 1 Red Gemstone, and 1 Yellow Gemstone to erect a 5x5 barrier centered around the caster. The caster must stand in a 7x7 area free of obstacles in order to begin casting Basilica. 
Anyone inside the barrier cannot use attacks, and anything outside the barrier cannot attack anyone inside it. Higher skill level increases its cast time, After Cast Delay, SP cost, and duration. Cannot be cast inside WoE castles.

This is a highly situational skill that may only be useful when your party does not have a Sorcerer that can cast Land Protector.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=481 |skill=Spiritual Thrift |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 0 ~ 5
| style="text-align: center;" | Passive, self buff
| Permanently reduces the SP cost of skills, up to -20% at Lv 5.

Generally only useful for Melee/Battle Priest build with low INT/very low MaxSP.
|}

==== Arch Bishop Skills ====
Praise Odin’s Glorious Beard and Bless Freya’s Bountiful Bosoms, Arch Bishops finally have more attack spells that deal damage on something other than Demon race and Undead element enemies. Those spells are Holy element though, so it’s a good idea to stick with leveling on Undead and Shadow element monsters.

| style="text-align: center;" | 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Damage, single target
| Consume 1 {{Item List |id=717 |item=Blue Gemstone |simple=yes}} to deal Holy element magic damage on a target in 10 hits, and has a chance to inflict Decrease Agility and/or Blind on the target.
The damage is increased with higher skill level and base level (up to approximately 2625% MATK at Lv 175, using Lv 10 Adoramus). The chances of inflicting Decrease AGI and Blind on a target is increased with higher skill level and job level (up to approximately 70% chance at Job Lv 60, using Lv 10 Adoramus). Has 2 second Skill Cooldown and '''currently in NovaRO [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/24305 there is no way to reduce this cooldown]'''.

The damage is increased by 200% when equipping {{Item List |id=16013 |item=Mace of Judgement |slots=2 |simple=yes}} (Lv 100) or {{Item List |id=16018 |item=Empowered Mace of Judgement |slots=1 |simple=yes}} set (i.e. the armor, weapon, garment, and footgear set must be equipped). Additionally, the damage is increased by 10% when equipping {{Item List |id=15095 |item=Hero Judgement Shawl |slots=1 |simple=yes}} (Lv 160).

If the caster stands next to an Acolyte-based character when casting Adoramus, it will not consume the caster's Blue Gemstone but will consume 12 SP from the other character. Adoramus can be instacast.

| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=2038 |skill=Judex |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 5
| style="text-align: center;" | Damage, single target, splash
| Deals Holy element magic damage on a target and enemies in a 3x3 area around it in 3 hits. The damage is increased with higher skill level and base level (up to approximately 700% MATK at Lv 175, using Judex Lv 5).
The damage is increased by 30% when equipping {{Item List |id=2472 |item=Shoes of Judgement |simple=yes}}, and increased by 10% when equipping {{Item List |id=15095 |item=Hero Judgement Shawl |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. Judex requires Sacrament and {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity |slots=1 |simple=yes}} to be insta-cast (see [[Temporal Boots]]).

Judex's low cast time, low Skill Cooldown, and splash damage makes it useful for triggering equipment effects (e.g. Wickebine's Black Cat Ears, Zaha Doll Hat) while dealing damage on a pack of mobs.

To properly utilize Judex, I recommend wearing {{Market |id=28604 Crimson Bible}}, {{Market |id=28805 Vicious Mind Book}}, or {{Market |id=1565 Ledger of Death}} (refined to +10 or higher) with {{Market |id=4607 Faithful Manager Card}} or MDEF-piercing card combo. While it's possible to apply Malangdo enchants on Ledger of Death, you may also consider {{Market |id=1560 Sage's Diary}}, {{Market |id=1572 Principles of Magic}}, {{Market |id=1573 Ancient Magic}}, or {{Market |id=1564 Encyclopedia}} + {{Market |id=2186 Revised Encyclopedia}} combo. Alternatively you may use Mace type weapons with MATK attribute such as {{Market |id=16013 Mace of Judgement}}, {{Market |id=16028 Thanatos Hammer}}, or Infinity Mace with Spell 5 ~ Spell 8 enchants (see [[Infinite Space]]).

With {{Market |id=27177 Marsh Arclouse Card}}, 185 ~ 193 ASPD, 100% Variable Cast Time reduction, Sacrament Lv 5, Temporal DEX Boots, Minstrel buffs, and &lt;code>/turbo&lt;/code> command [https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/7436-introducing-novaext-updated-april-15th%C2%A02018/ enabled via NovaExt], you can turn Judex into your very own Holy Machine Gun.

| Deals low Holy element magic damage on Undead element monsters. Can be used on Barricades in WoE 2.0 castles to restore their durability.
Renovatio can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=2569 |item=Shawl of Affection |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=2990 |item=Pendant of Harmony |simple=yes}} (autocast on self).
|-

| style="text-align: center;" | 5 ~ 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Defensive, caster and party members only
| Applies barriers on the caster and all party members onscreen that block physical damage and prevent flinching from physical attacks. The durability is 30% of the player's MaxHP.
Higher skill level increases the number of hits the barrier blocks (up to 16 hits), lengthens the Skill Cooldown (up to 40 seconds), and increases the SP cost. More party members increases the barrier's defense bonus.

Odin's Power Lv 1 is enabled when equipping {{Item List |id=2156 |item=Bible of Promise Vol. 1 |slots=1 |simple=yes}}, and Lv 2 is enabled when equipping {{Item List |id=2162 |item=Bible of Promise Vol. 2 |slots=1 |simple=yes}}.

| style="text-align: center;" | 1 ~ 5
| style="text-align: center;" | Self buff/recovery
| Removes various debuffs from the caster (Bleeding, Hallucination, Mandragora Howling, GX poisons, etc), and temporarily increases the HP recovered/damage dealt when the caster uses Heal, Sanctuary, Coluceo Heal, and Highness Heal, while simultaneously increasing the SP cost of those skills. Higher skill level reduces Offertorium's cast time, increases Offertorium's SP cost, and increases the effectiveness (up to +150%) and SP cost (up to +200% SP cost) of healing skills. Casting Offertorium will remove Magnificat, vice versa.
A full support build may maximize this skill but for an exorcist, getting this skill at Lv 1 is sufficient for when you need to quickly remove debuffs from yourself. You can cast Sanctuary then follow it up with Offertorium to boost Sanctuary’s damage and HP recovery amount, while bypassing the initial extra SP cost.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=5014 |skill=Full Throttle |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 0 ~ 5
| style="text-align: center;" | Self buff/recovery
| Fully restores your HP, and temporarily increases movement speed and increases base stats by 20%. Skill level increases the duration, for up to 30 seconds at Lv 5. Has a 30 minute cooldown.
After Full Throttle ends you will be inflicted by Rebound temporarily. During Rebound your movement speed decreases and your natural HP and SP recovery is disabled.

The long cooldown makes this skill’s functionality rather dubious, however you can use the additional stats to slightly boost your MATK and reduce Variable Cast Time for a short period of time.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | {{Skill List |id=2046 |skill=Oratio |simple=yes}}
| style="text-align: center;" | 5 ~ 10
| style="text-align: center;" | Debuff/utility, caster-centered AoE
| Decreases the Holy resistance of enemies in a 31x31 area for 30 seconds. Higher skill level increases the chance (up to 90% chance), and the percentage of Holy property resistance reduction (up to 20% resistance reduction). Oratio affects normal monsters, Boss monsters, and invisible enemies (Hiding, Cloaking, Hide).
Oratio can be autocast when equipping {{Item List |id=2570 |item=Shawl of Judgement |simple=yes}}.

A good pre-cast to use especially when facing enemies that often use Hiding/Cloaking.

| Removes various debuffs and statuses from a target. Higher skill level increases the success rate (68% at Lv 1, up to 100% at Lv 5) and SP cost.
Has 10 second Skill Cooldown that can be reduced when wearing {{Item List |id=1586 |item=+6 Vellum Bible |simple=yes}} in BG/WoE maps.

Clearance is mainly used in WoE situations, and in instance dungeon raids to [https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/1343-archbishop-clearance/?do=findComment&amp;comment=7114 remove buffs from a normal monster], or as an alternative to Dispell for removing Steel Body and Berserk, and to remove debuffs that can’t be removed with your other recovery skills.

Higher skill level increases the AoE (9x9 at Lv 1, up to 17x17 at Lv 5), the Silence duration, and the SP cost.

Success rate is affected by the target's base level, VIT, and LUK.

=== Understanding Magnus Exorcismus ===
First of all, we must distinguish between Undead ''Race'' and Undead ''Element''. This is because '''Magnus Exorcismus and Sanctuary only deal damage on Demon Race and Undead Element monsters'''. Sanctuary will deal damage on all Undead element monsters, and all Demon race monsters regardless of its element. On everything else, Magnus Exorcismus has no effect, and Sanctuary will heal anyone that steps into it. You must ''always be mindful'' of the race and element of enemies you are fighting against.

Before you cast ME, you can use the &lt;code>@mi&lt;/code> command in-game to check detailed monster info. The following tables show a small sample of monsters and MVPs, and how you can deal damage to them using your main offensive skills (Adoramus, ME, Sanctuary, Heal, and Highness Heal).

It’s very important to understand that Magnus Exorcismus is not a burst damage spell. It’s a '''damage-over-time''' spell that deals damage in waves, where the total damage is shown in large yellow numbers, at 3 second intervals. At level 10, it will inflict 10 hits of 100% Holy element magic damage in one wave, and a monster can receive up to 5 waves. This whole process will take around 14 seconds.

* For example, the Immortal Corps in the screenshot below received 3,499 damage x 10 hits = 34,990 damage from one wave of Magnus Exorcismus. Hits are shown in white numbers. Wave damage (or the damage bundle, the total damage from all hits) is shown in large yellow numbers.
* If that Immortal Corps received the full damage from Magnus Exorcismus, in 14 seconds it will receive roughly 30,000 damage x 5 waves = 150,000 damage (note that MATK has a range which will cause your damage to fluctuate somewhat).
* If that Immortal Corps was under Lex Aeterna, it would receive ((3,499 damage x 10 hits) x 2) 69,980 damage from one wave of Magnus Exorcismus. Lex Aeterna affects the damage bundle, not the damage of each hit.

&lt;div>&lt;ul> 
&lt;li style="display: inline-block;"> [[File:ME wave damage.PNG|thumb|White numbers are hit damage. Large yellow numbers are the wave damage. Lex Aeterna will double the value of the wave damage.]] &lt;/li>
&lt;li style="display: inline-block;"> [[File:AB ME cast time.gif|thumb|Insta-cast Kyrie Eleison indicates that 100% Variable Cast Time reduction has been reached. However, ME still has left-over Fixed Cast Time that cannot be eliminated with Sacrament, 120 base DEX, and 0.5 second Fixed Cast Time reduction from Temporal DEX Boots.]] &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;/div>

&lt;span style="color:#0000FF">ME's cast time can be reduced to 1 second&lt;/span> with 100% Variable Cast Time reduction (Total INT + (Total DEX*2) = 530), Sacrament, and 0.5 second Fixed Cast Time reduction of {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity |slots=1 |simple=yes}}. Without After Cast Delay reducing gears, and without Poem of Bragi buff, the After Cast Delay of Magnus Exorcismus is 4 seconds. So while enemies are receiving damage from Magnus Exorcismus, you have 10 seconds to cast other skills and/or stack more damage on it.

== Equipment and Cards ==
=== Judgement Set for Adoramus ===
Adoramus’ damage is doubled when the complete Judgement Set is equipped. The complete set also increases the damage that the wearer deals on Undead and Demon monsters, increases the wearer’s resistance against them, and includes a Shadow-element armor. Similarly to the Affection Set, all parts of the set can be enchanted, it lacks slots for cards, and it is not suitable if you often find yourself tanking non-Demon and non-Undead enemies.

* All parts of the Judgement set can be purchased with Mora Coins from Keeper of Secrets in Mora &lt;code>/navi mora 89/90&lt;/code>. See [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Wandering_Guardian_Quest Wandering Guardian quest], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Hazy_Forest Hazy Forest instance dungeon], [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mora_Daily_Quests Mora Daily Quests], and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mora_Enchants#Artifact_Collector_.28Arch_Bishop_.26_Warlock.29 Mora Enchants] for details on how to obtain and enchant them.
* You'd want to get stat enchants on Judgement set pieces, such as DEX +4, INT +2 ~ +4, and MATK +2%, or defensive enchants such as MDEF +6.
* If refined to +9, Empowered Mace of Judgement can receive magic type enchants such as:
** {{Item List |id=4814 |item=Spell 2 |simple=yes}} (MATK +9, Cast Time -9%), INT +2, DEX +2 (slot 1)
** {{Item List |id=4887 |item=Spell 3 |simple=yes}} (MATK +15, Cast Time -3%), INT +3, DEX +3 (slot 2)
** {{Item List |id=4888 |item=Spell 4 |simple=yes}} (MATK +20, Cast Time -3%), INT +4, DEX +4 (slot 3).
* Alternatively, you can browse the Vending page and buy {{Market |id=16013 Mace of Judgement}}, {{Market |id=15030 Robe of Judgement}}, {{Market |id=2570 Shawl of Judgement}}, and {{Market |id=2472 Shoes of Judgement}} from other players.
** Additionally, you can search for cheap {{Market |id=2864 Light of Cure}}, {{Market |id=2865 Seal of Cathedral}}, or {{Market |id=2866 Ring of Archbishop}} in the Vending page or in @go market in-game. Carry the rings on a non-Arch Bishop character, and talk to the Keeper of Secrets NPC, then select the exchange ring options to exchange one ring into 10 Mora Coins. Use the Mora Coins to buy Judgement set from the NPC.

You can wear the Judgement Set when you're leveling solo, then swap to your healing/support gears when you're leveling in a party. Note that Robe of Judgement makes you more vulnerable against most monster races, and very weak against Holy element. You can mitigate this somewhat by carrying multiple Shields containing racial resist cards such as Thara Frog (Demi Human), Orc Warrior (Brute), Big Foot (Insect), Rafflesia (Fish).

Besides the Gray Armor Set, the Arch Bishop-only Robe of Affection, Priest skill B.S. Sacramenti, and Royal Guard skill Piety, Holy resistance is usually difficult to obtain, or too expensive for most people to afford. It is crucial to swap out the Robe of Judgement when you're facing enemies that use Holy attacks/spells.

=== Magnus Exorcismus Gears ===
Magnus Exorcismus' (ME) long cast time makes it impractical to use before you have high enough stats and other cast time reducing gears, and its damage may be lacking without gears that specifically increases its damage. On the other hand, once you're wearing the appropriate gears, you can cast ME to assist your party when dealing against Demon race, and Undead element monsters.

* This is the go-to set for increasing Magnus Exorcismus damage. I personally found that the global cooldown caused by autocast Turn Undead from Holy Stick + Exorcism Bible combo to be disruptive (since I don't always party with a Bard class character).
* Usually I'd ditch Holy Stick and Exorcism Bible (or just the Bible) and wear a different weapon and shield, since I'm particularly fond of the MDEF-piercing card sets of {{Card |id=4654 Nightmare Mimic Card}} + {{Card |id=4653 Nightmare Arclouse Card}} and {{Card |id=4626 Big Ben Card}} + {{Card |id=4628 Neo Punk Card}}. Overupgrading Shrine Maiden Ribbon is important to compensate for the ME damage loss from not wearing Holy Stick + Exorcism Bible combo.

* The 4 second After Cast Delay of ME can be disastrous, and not everybody has a friend who is also a dedicated Bard class player (or willing/able to multi-client a Bard). The alternative is to wear equipment with After Cast Delay reduction such as Sprint Set or Diabolus Robe.
* All parts of Sprint Set are dropped by monsters in New World fields. See [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cat_Hand_Services#New_World_access_quest Cat Hand Services] for details on how to access New World fields.

* This set is (used to be?) pretty popular among Mage class, and I think it would serve exorcist ABs well. The one issue I have with it is that the weapons have no slot(s) for weapon cards, so refining and enchanting them would be necessary to bring out this set's potential.

* Excellion Set and Blueprints for its enchants can be created using {{Item List |id=6962 |item=Old Fuel Tanks |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=6961 |item=Huge Metal Scraps |simple=yes}} dropped by enemies inside [[Charleston Crisis]] instance. Visit the two robots PLUTO_09 and MARS_01 in Verus town &lt;code>/navi verus04 162/219&lt;/code> or see [[Verus Equipment Exchange]] page for details.
* The set's Skill Delay reduction is perfect to enable you to spam skills, and with the right enchants it can improve your magic damage as well. The only downside is that you can not put Armor and Garment cards in it, so cards like Banshee Master or Antique Book card are a no-go.
* '''Recommended enchants''':
** {{Item List |id=4983 |item=INT Supplement Reactor |simple=yes}}: Can only be applied once on Excellion Suit. Every 10 Base INT, MATK +5. If refined to +7 or higher, MATK +10. At 120 Base INT and if applied on +7 Excellion Suit, this enchant gives 70 MATK.
** {{Item List |id=4987 |item=Magic Supplement Reactor |simple=yes}}: MATK +20. Can be applied up to 3 times on Excellion Suit and on Excellion Wing.
** {{Item List |id=4981 |item=Recovery 202 Reactor |simple=yes}}: SP Recovery +50%.  If refined to +7, additional SP Recovery +50%. Can be applied up to 3 times on Excellion Suit and on Excellion Wing.
** {{Item List |id=4989 |item=SP Supplement Reactor |simple=yes}}: MaxSP +3%. Can be applied up to 3 times on Excellion Suit and on Excellion Wing.

'''Faceworm + Temporal Set (Lv 99 Arch Bishop)''': {{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin |slots= 1 |simple=yes}} (Garment) + Any Temporal (Stat) Boots (Footgear) (e.g. Temporal DEX Boots, Temporal VIT Boots)
** '''Set bonus''': MaxHP +15%, MaxSP +5%.
** Giant Snake Skins (GSS) are obtainable from [[Faceworm's Nest]], and they come pre-refined and pre-enchanted with random stat enchants. [[Temporal Boots]] are crafted using materials obtained from [[Old Glast Heim]].
** Besides the MaxHP and MaxSP bonus, you'd want to look for (at least) +8 GSS, unless you use cards that require the Garment to be at a specific refine level (e.g. {{Card |id=4375 Orc Baby Card}}). This is because the Special Stat enchant will give additional stats according to the GSS's refine level (up to Stat +4).
*** For example, Special DEX enchant gives DEX +1, and if the GSS is refined to +8, it will give an additional DEX +3.
** &lt;u>For additional MATK and MaxSP&lt;/u>: +8 GSS with {{Item List |id=4856 |item=Special INT |simple=yes}} and INT enchants (e.g. Special INT, INT +7, INT +7).
** &lt;u>To reduce Variable Cast Time&lt;/u>: +8 GSS with {{Item List |id=4857 |item=Special DEX |simple=yes}} and DEX and/or INT enchants (e.g. Special DEX, DEX+7, DEX +7).
*** A +9 GSS with Special INT or Special DEX will also give MATK +1%.
*** A +12 GSS with Special INT/Special DEX will also decrease Fixed Cast Time (FCT) by 7%. However, note that &lt;u>percentage FCT reduction does not stack&lt;/u>. In other words, FCT -7% from a +12 GSS will be overwritten by Lv 5 Sacrament's FCT -50% effect.

* I highly recommend this set for Arch Bishops that plan to level with ME. With the right enchantments, the Ancient Rift set can minimize your Variable Cast Time, boost your MaxHP, while enabling uninterruptible casting, all of which are necessary to help you learn to utilize ME well.
* All parts of the Ancient Rift Set can be purchased (and enchanted) with {{Item List |id=6905 |item=Shattered Magic Stones |simple=yes}}, obtained from [[Infinite Space]] instance dungeon.

* The armor alone gives a huge boost to your MATK according to your base level, and that makes Flattery Robe a must-have for all spell casters. I can't say much about the combo (the other combo with Survivor's Manteau is better but it's only for Mage &amp; Soul Linker class) but you should definitely grab the armor and enchant it.

* All parts of the Airship Armor set can be obtained from [[Airship Assault]] instance. They can not be refined and do not have slots for cards. 
* This is still a pretty good set to hold you over while you work on enchanting the Ancient Rift set, or while you're still working on pumping INT and DEX to reduce your Variable Cast Time.
* Note that percentage Variable Cast Time reduction becomes less effective the closer you are to 100% VCT reduction. Use &lt;code>@battlestats&lt;/code> command in-game to check your VCT reduction.

=== About Nightmare Clock Tower and Nightmare Pyramid Card Sets ===

The Nightmare Clock Tower card set (Big Ben + Neo Punk) and Nightmare Pyramid card set (Nightmare Mimic + Nightmare Arclouse) are probably often overlooked. From my personal experience, the MDEF-ignoring effect of these card sets have enabled my Adoramus to deal decent damage against enemies in instances.
* '''Nightmare Clock Tower Set: Big Ben + Neo Punk combo (anti Demon and Formless race)''':
** [[Charleston Crisis]] (All Demon race monsters)
** [[Devil's Tower]] (Demon race enemies plus the Magic Seals being Formless race)
** [[Horror Toy Factory]] (Lots of Demon race monsters in the first phase of the instance, prior to Celine Kimi)
** [[Last Room]] (Formless race enemies and Demon race boss monster)
** [[Monster Hunter]]: Black Celestial Tendrillion (Demon/Dark 3) and Domovoi (Formless/Ghost 1)
** [[Morse Cave]] (All the normal monsters are Demon race)
** [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] (All Demon race monsters)
** [[Old Glast Heim]]: Root of Corruption is Earth element, Demon race in Normal mode; Formless race in Hard mode.
** [[Sarah and Fenrir]] (All Gigantes are Demon race)
** [[Sky Fortress]] (The Immortal Shadows are Demon race, and the Immortal Cursed Knight is Formless race)
** [[Temple of the Demon God]] (Brinaranea, Muspelskoll, their slaves, and Morroc are all Demon race)

* '''Nightmare Pyramid Set: Nightmare Mimic + Nightmare Arclouse combo (anti Undead and Brute race)''':
** [[Bios Island]] (Some Brute race enemies in the first and second area; and Undead race enemies in the boss area. Grim Reaper Yanku is Undead race).
** [[Horror Toy Factory]] (Celine Kimi, Antonio Manager, and Spooky Demon are Undead race)
** [[Monster Hunter]]: Ice Troll (Brute/Neutral 3)
** [[Old Glast Heim]] (Amdarais and all other monsters, except Maggots and Root of Corruption)
** [[Room of Consciousness]] (Every enemy in this instance are Undead race)
** [[Sky Fortress]] (Zombies, Immortal Fortress Legion, and the final boss Stefan J. E. Wolf are Undead race)

It would be wise to get these card sets if you are planning to run the aforementioned instances often.

=== Pets ===
See [[Pet System]] for details.
* {{Item List |id=9089 |item=Am Mut |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, MATK +4%. A good choice all-round for offensive spell caster build.
* {{Item List |id=9026 |item=Zealotus |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, MATK +2% against Demi Human race. Good choice if you run [[Geffen Magic Tournament]] often.
* {{Item List |id=9094 |item=Leaf Lunatic |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, magic damage against Formless race +6%. High level Formless race monsters (e.g. mobs around Verus and in Nightmare Clock Tower) tend to be Neutral element. This pet may work well when combined with Cobalt Mineral carded weapon (magic damage against Formless race +10%) and/or Big Ben carded weapon (magic damage against Formless race +5%) + Neo Punk carded shield (ignore 50% MDEF of Formless and Demon race) combo.
* {{Item List |id=9107 |item=Ancient Mummy |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, magic damage against Dragon race +6%. This pet may work well with Draco Egg carded weapon. A very situational pet considering there aren't a lot of Dragon race monsters worth hunting for loot or levels, with very few exceptions like Detale/Detardeurus, Nidhoggur, Buwaya, and Bakonawa.
* {{Item List |id=9048 |item=Miyabi Doll |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, INT +1, Variable Cast Time -3% Consider this pet for a bit of cast time reduction.
* {{Item List |id=9088 |item=Angeling |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, Heal effeciveness +8%, MaxHP +2%. A must-have pet for healer hybrids.
* {{Item List |id=9052 |item=Incubus |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, MaxSP +5%. Consider getting this pet if you're having issues with SP consumption.
* {{Item List |id=9108 |item=Abandoned Bear Doll |simple=yes}}: When Loyal, MaxSP +150, low chance to restore 40 SP per second for 5 seconds when using magic attacks. Consider getting this pet if the SP consumption from Reckless Magic is too hard on your SP.

== Leveling Spots ==
=== Lv 1 - 99 ===
Before you get skills such as Turn Undead, Magnus Exorcismus, and/or Adoramus, you would level similarly to how Full Support build would level solo.

Tip: Wear {{Item List |id=2677 |item=Spiritual Ring |simple=yes}} with {{Item List |id=2607 |item=Clip |slots=1 |simple=yes}} / {{Item List |id=2608 |item=Rosary |simple=yes}} to increase your Heal damage against Undead monsters.

** Pick up the other quests (e.g. Turtle Dungeon, Rachel Area, Glast Heim Area, etc) and party with other players to complete them. Turn them in later when you have job changed into High Acolyte/High Priest/Baby Arch Bishop (if you are a Baby Priest).
** Party with other players and grind on Desert Wolves, Magma Dungeon, Magmarings, etc until you reach 99/70 (as a High Priest) or 99/50 (as a Baby Priest).
* '''Lv 1 (High Novice)''': Kill a couple monsters outside Izlude then job change into High Acolyte.
* '''High Acolyte''': Go to Port Malaya, bring 6 Blue Gemstones and 6 Holy Water, and complete the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village Quest]. It should give you enough job experience to hit Job Lv 50, and you'll be able to job change into High Priest.

=== Lv 100+ ===
If you have been saving up completed Eden Board and Gramps Quests before job changing into Arch Bishop, by the time you turn them all in, you should have enough job levels to learn new offensive skills such as Highness Heal or Adoramus. Considering your best offensive skills are single target, the following will recommend Eden Board Quests that send you to maps with relatively low mob density. Visit Eden Headquarters (@go eden) and walk upstairs to check out the Eden Board Quests.

* '''Lv 100''': Complete some of the [[Banquet for Heroes]] quests. They give delicious amounts of base and job experience, and you can earn [[Honor Token]] too. The [[Banquet for Heroes Daily Quests]] are repeatable daily quests that reward you with experience as well, though you may have to stack some items and/or invite a friend to help you hunt monsters and collect the quest items.
** If you are soloing I recommend the following quests; ''Learning About the Families'', ''Ritual of Blessing'', ''The Geoborgs'', ''The Roegenburgs'', ''The Dress Dilemma'' daily quest, ''The Wigners'', and ''The Maid and Jurgen'' daily quest. Last but not least, completing ''The Royal Head Chef'' quest will enable you to do ''The Perfect Sauce'', ''Dish Cleaning'', and ''Serving the Grilled Griffin'' daily quests.
** If you're partying with a friend, you could complete [[Room of Consciousness]] instance, and later you can receive daily Bijou killing quest from Friedrich Heine. At higher levels and with better gears, it's definitely possible for an AB to solo this instance. In NovaRO, you can enter Room of Consciousness instance with a party of 2 or more people. 
** Tip: Use Turn Undead, or hold Shift and cast Resurrection on Renovated Amdarais (#3448) in [[Room of Consciousness]]. This does not seem to work on Enhanced Amdarais (#3449) that Bijou summons as her slaves, though.
* '''Lv 100 - Lv 110''':
** Ice Dungeon (Snowier, Ice Titan, and Gazeti).
** Other Regions (Medusa, Anubis)

** Kiel Dungeon (Aliza, Aliot, Alicel)
** Other Regions (Wakwak (Warper -> Instances -> Bangungot Hospital 2F), Hell Hound (Cursed Abbey 1F), Ancient Mummy (Pyramid Base 2F))
** [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/map/gl_chyard_ Nightmare Glast Heim]: You can access this dungeon by talking to the Fallen Priest NPC near the entrance to Glast Heim Castle &lt;code>glast_01 190/273&lt;/code>. Select "First Floor (Lv 100-130)" and pay her 5,000 Zeny to enter the dungeon. Watch out for the [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/2479/mimic-nightmare Nightmare Mimic].

* '''Lv 125''': Minimum level to access [[Airship Assault]].
* '''Lv 130''': Minimum level to access [[Devil's Tower]], [[Charleston Crisis]], and [[Old Glast Heim]]. It's recommended to try OGH Normal mode first.

** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Continental_Guard_Quest_%28Resurrection_of_Satan_Morroc%29 Dimensional Gorge] or [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dimensional_Travel Fire Basin]. Pick up all four Incarnations of Morroc.
*** If the Bleeding debuff they cast are too disruptive on you, consider getting Offertorium to quickly remove it.
*** Beware of the [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1921/incarnation-of-morocc Ghost] and [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1918/incarnation-of-morocc Angel] Incarnations of Morroc. The Ghost type heals other monsters, and the Angel type can cast Magic Mirror to reflect magic back at you. The reflect chance is not 100% but trust me, there's no death that's simultaneously as &lt;i>hilarious and despair-inducing&lt;/i> as being killed by Magic Mirror.
** Gathering Quests: 35 Crystal of Darkness (dropped by all Incarnations of Morroc), 35 Torn Magic Book (dropped by [http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1870/necromancer Necromancer] in Cursed Abbey 3F)
* '''Lv 140''': This is the minimum level to do a number of pre-requisite quests that will grant you access to new fields, dungeons, and instance dungeons.
** Minimum level to access [[Horror Toy Factory]].
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Dimensional_Travel Dimensional Travel]: Pre-requisite quest to access [[Bios Island]]. After completing this quest, you can access [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Fire_Basin_Quests Fire Basin], where Incarnation of Morroc also spawns.
** [[Banquet for Heroes]]: 140 is the minimum level required to access the ''Restricted Sector'' (the Underground Prison beneath Prontera), and to do some of the [[Banquet for Heroes Daily Quests]]. Here are some recommendations for '''''The Royal Richard'' daily quest''':
*** '''Undead race''': Regretful Memory in [[Ghost Palace]], Immortal Corps and Zombie Guards in Invaded Prontera, Fire Bug in the Fire Basin, Nightmare Ancient Mummy in Nightmare Pyramid Basement.
*** '''Brute race''': Frozen Wolf and Taffy in Prontera Dungeon, Parus in [[Hazy Forest]], Petal in Eclage Field (outside Bifrost Tower dungeon), Fire Condor and Fire Frilldora in Fire Basin.
*** '''Demon race''': [[Horror Toy Factory]], [[Morse Cave]]
*** '''Formless race''': Fire Sandman and Fire Golem in Fire Basin; Big Ben and Big Bell in Nightmare Clock Tower.

** Hunting Quest: Nightmare Clock Tower (Neo Punk, Big Bell, Big Ben)
** Gathering Quest: Handcuffs, Research Chart (dropped by first job ghosts in Biolabs 1F)
** You're probably better off partying or killing MvPs at this point. If you're going to kill MvPs, it's highly recommended to stick with Demon race and/or Shadow/Undead element MvPs. Of course you can use Adoramus to damage MvPs other than Demon race and/or Shadow/Undead element, however be sure to avoid all Holy element monsters.
* '''Lv 145 - Lv 175''': Join Gramps parties and complete the Gramps Hunting Quests.
* '''Lv 150''': Minimum level to participate in [[Monster Hunter]]. You do not earn EXP from completing Monster Hunter, however it's a good idea to start farming for your Shadow Gears as soon as possible. Parties may pigeonhole you to healing and supporting roles, although you are free to assist your party by dealing damage as long as you're confident with your multi-tasking capabilities. With that said, you will most likely have to stick to healing and supporting when fighting Golden Boitata.
* '''Lv 160''': Minimum level to access [[Bios Island]], [[Morse Cave]], and [[Temple of the Demon God]]. Recommended level to attempt [[Old Glast Heim]] Hard mode.

== Post 175/60 ==
Most guilds and parties in the server seek Full Support Arch Bishops, and they are indeed abundant compared to Exorcist Arch Bishops. That's not to say Exorcist builds have no place in a guild or a party. It's important to acknowledge that being an exclusive Holy element spell caster, this build has a considerably shorter list of enemies they can effectively and efficiently damage compared to other spell casters and physical attackers.

Additionally, it is not uncommon for [[Battlegrounds]] and War of Emperium participants to wear {{Card |id=4054 Angeling Card}} Armor or have [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Piety Piety] buff on them, which would render Adoramus useless. With that said, there are players that wear {{Card |id=4141 Evil Druid Card}} Armor to avoid Freezing and Stone Curse debuff. If you can find this player who is immune to both, you may have an opportunity to attack. However, take ''extreme precaution'', as having 100 hard MDEF also makes them resist those debuffs and your magic damage.

In [[instances]], an Exorcist Arch Bishop can be a tertiary or secondary damage dealer against Demon race, and Shadow and Undead element enemies. This includes but not limited to:
* Black Celestial Tendrillion in [[Monster Hunter]]
* Normal mobs in [[Horror Toy Factory]]
* Everything in [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]]
* Everything in [[Old Glast Heim]] except Maggots

As you can see, in most of these instances, parties will always seek for Arch Bishops to fill in the role of healer and support. Despite being on Exorcist build, I think it's important to fulfill the role of healer/support before you begin to assist in damaging. Be mindful of your skill cooldowns and everyone's health. Remember that due to most Arch Bishop skills having individual skill cooldowns, it's possible for you to weave Coluceo Heal, Highness Heal and other defensive/recovery skills in between casting Adoramus, Judex, and Sanctuary. Additionally, communicating with fellow Arch Bishops and other support-oriented job classes is important to ensure you deal as much damage as possible, while also fulfilling your role as healer.

* '''Arch Bishop''': 
** Make sure enemies are inflicted with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Oratio Oratio].
** Stick close to the other Arch Bishop in your party as much as possible, so that you can cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Adoramus Adoramus] without consuming Blue Gemstones.
** If you can't afford to swap out your shield to equip Bible of Promise, kindly ask if the other Arch Bishop has [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Odin%27s_Power Odin's Power] and have them cast it on you.
** If there are at least two Acolyte-based characters in the party, see if you can arrange yourselves so that all three characters stand side by side to enable [http://irowiki.org/wiki/B.S_Sacramenti B.S. Sacramenti].
* '''Sorcerer''':
** Ask if they have [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mind_Breaker Mind Breaker] and have them cast it on normal mobs ('''''only if''''' the mob don't normally cast magic spells that deal particularly high damage). Otherwise, have them [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Player_Commands#Duel_and_Battlegrounds-related_Commands @duel] you and cast Mind Breaker on you, as it will greatly increase your magic damage.
** Inform the Sorcerer if you are planning to use Magnus Exorcismus on the enemy, as your spell will not work if the enemy is standing inside the Sorcerer's [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Magnetic_Earth Land Protector].
* '''Royal Guard''': From my observation, there are very few Royal Guards in PvM that uses [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gospel Gospel]. If you find one that does, stick close to them and ask them to activate it when your party is fighting boss monsters. There's a chance that you'll gain all stats +20 buff from their Gospel, which will boost your magic damage.
* '''Mechanic (Mado Gear)''': Ask if they have [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Analyze Analyze] and have them use it on enemies and boss monsters, for a chance to reduce their MDEF.
* '''Wanderer''':
** Ask if she has [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Moonlight_Serenade Moonlight Serenade] and have her cast it for you.
** If there is a Maestro casting [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Windmill_Rush Windmill Rush] in the party, you and the Wanderer will have to stand a bit further from the party so that she doesn't overwrite the Maestro's Windmill Rush while allowing you to get her Moonlight Serenade buff.
* '''Oboro''': On the off chance that you party with an Oboro in dungeons or instances, ask if she can cast [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Distorted_Crescent Distorted Crescent] on you. Make sure your CURRENT SP ends in an EVEN number (0, 2, 6, 8) before she casts Distorted Crescent on you, so that you get the MATK buff.

Other ways to boost your magic damage include consuming food items from [[Sara's Memory]], {{Item List |id=12430 |item=Warg Blood Cocktail |simple=yes}} (craftable with Genetic's skill [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mixed_Cooking Mixed Cooking]), and {{Item List |id=12031 |item=Box of Drowsiness |simple=yes}} (obtainable when killing Fish monsters while wearing {{Card |id=4228 Sleeper Card}} accessory).
