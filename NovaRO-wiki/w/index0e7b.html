== Overview == 
Once the leftover class made by Gravity with subpar survival abilities at the cost of good firepower, Rebels made recently a comeback thanks to a co-joined update between Korean and Japanese servers of Ragnarok Online. Their power and their survivability improved, Rebels are now ready to take the grounds again and shut the people that once doubted them.

I am Fyrus, also known as [GM] Carmin. I worked on this update together with the Staff of NovaRO to make this dream come true. While Gravity changed how this class works compared to their previous iteration, they also make some work on the old Gunslinger skills to make them a bit different, powerful, or even something else altogether. Working the Gunslinger out of nothing and the fear my progress would be wiped at any day, I continued my efforts to hope they would not be wasted.

Look at where we are now.

== Stats, your first friend is this world. ==
Building a Rebel is similar to building an Archer, as they both use DEX to improve their damage, and AGI, to improve their attack speed and flee. Let's go into detail a bit more.

* '''STR '''is used for your weight capacity (+30 per point) and to add some minor increase on your damage. This stat is also used to help reduce some statuses. It's up to you about the amount you want to put there, but I wouldn't go above 30 or 50, first, because Gym passes are easy to come by on NovaRO, and second, because you'll probably get more attack out of raising your LUK.
* '''AGI '''is a mandatory stat to raise your ASPD and flee (It's possible to build ASPD on some other things too, but mainly for this). Rebels don't have too much of an hard time reaching the maximum ASPD for their skills, but flee is useful to have in some PvM situations.
* '''VIT''' is an important stat to raise your max HP and a minor damage decrease. Raising your HP will allow you to survive more things, and it also helps on the Platinum Altar barrier you can get.
* '''INT '''is another important stat you can raise to improve your max SP, as some Rebel skills have quite a high SP cost, it's also useful if you stacked on Matk for Magic Bullet. It also makes your cast time slightly faster.
* '''DEX''', What would a ranged class be without Dex ? Not only this is your main source of damage, but it also improves your Hit rate and your cast time more than Int does.
* '''LUK''' is a secondary source of damage, but it also raises your Crit rate and your Perfect dodge.

== Skills ==
[[File:GSRESkill.png|200px|thumb|right|The new skill tree]]
Skills are an important part of every class in RO, Gunslingers and Rebels have a mechanic similar to Monks and their Spheres in the form of '''Coins'''. Skills may have a coin cost associated with them and can be gained by using the skill '''Coin Flip''', or, when you're a Rebel, the '''Rich's Coin''' skill. Coins are displayed around the user as floating orbs of light, and each grants a passive +3 Attack boost.

|'''Fire Dance'''
|12~20
|0

|'''Howling Mine'''
|40~60
|0
|1
|5~3
|This skill plants a mine on an enemy that must then be detonated by Flicker. It does good damage but requires the use of a Grenade Launcher.

|60~100
|0

|70
|0
|1

|40~60
|0
|1
|3~1
|Deals damage in a large area around the user for high damage, if targets collide into a wall, they'll take additionnal damage from this. At level 5 it's quite spammable and can be used to get out of some tight situations due to its large AoE. Consumes '''5 bullets'''.

== Your equipment and you. ==
=== Weapons ===
Unlike most other classes, Rebels have &lt;u>the largest selection of weapon types&lt;/u> available to them. While Gunslingers didn't need for Grenade Launchers or Rifles, Rebels can make pretty good use of each type. Sadly higher guns are a lot expensive for starters, so it's recommended to use a Merchant's Overcharge to buy them. All these weapons can be bought from the '''Firearms merchant''' in Prontera. ('''&lt;u>/navi prontera 139/225&lt;/u>'''). To use these, you will also need bullets, that can be bought at the '''Ammo dealer''' ('''&lt;u>/navi prontera 142/228&lt;/u>''')

== Leveling tips ==
Gunslingers and Rebels have high damaging skills that can come in handy while mobbing, but their skills have sometimes high SP costs or ammo requirements, especially considering the steep price of bullets over arrows.

==== As a Novice ====
While your stats may not look like it, you are strong enough to punch Porings south of Prontera and get your first needed job skills points. The Criatura academy can also give you tips and pointers, along with levels, and changing your job class within its walls. You can also change your job in Prontera by talking to the Job Master, and doing so will give you a freebie box of consumable and other useful things.

==== As a Gunslinger ====
Now that you can use guns and shoot monsters, you're usually given a Novice gun to help you early on. Take some bullets and head to Payon then to the east, there you can find '''Spores''' to help you on early leveling and getting skills

After level 26, go to '''Eden''' (@go eden), register by talking to '''Evenor Lime, '''then talk to '''Boya'''. She will give you a hunting quest for Payon Cave (you can access it via the warper) but you may want to take some '''Silver Bullets''' first. When at the cave, head outside, and talk to the '''Eden Group Member Karl'''. He will ask you to hunt Skeletons and Poporings in the cave. Once this is done and you talk to him, you can go back to Eden and talk to Boya to get better starting equipments. You can continue leveling in Payon cave floors 1 and 2 until you're base level 40-45.

After you're done with Payon Cave, you may head to Orc Dungeon and start mobbing there (via Desperado preferably). This is a good place to level up until the 65-70 level range. You may also go to Eden and take another hunting quest for this dungeon once you're base level 50, which will give you again, a more powerful weapon and armors. You can find the '''Eden Group Member Hooksha''' outside of Orc Dungeon when you first warp in.

Further down at base level 70, you can get a mission from '''Ur''' at Eden for '''Glast Heim St. Abbey''', where the Eden Member '''Johan''' waiting outside of it. Like before, this quest will give you the most powerful equipment Eden can offer you at this level. For this quest you wil have to hunt Wraiths and Evil Druids.

At this point you might be around level 80-85 with pretty good equipment from Eden. You may do Eden board missions of your level to keep progressing and get exp, or you can also start doing '''Gramps quests'''. They're big hunting quests designated for parties that give a lot of experience and levels.

If you feel more like going solo, you can go to other places like '''Turtle Island''', '''Ice Cave''', '''East field from Rachel''', or '''South field from Veins'''. Using either of those options, you can continue progressing up until level 99. When you do, you can job change into a '''Rebellion'''.

==== As a Rebellion ====
Now that you are a Rebel, you will gain access to more weapons and more importantly, skills to make deadly use of them.You can continue to do Gramps and Eden Boards quests to level, but if you ever run out of ideas (or waiting for your cooldowns to run out), here are a few suggestions:

'''Level 99-110 :''' Pinguiculas east of Splendide are a nice place, although Luciolas might hurt at this point. If you're feeling adventurous or good at mobbing, you could try to level in '''Magma Dungeon F2'''.

'''Level 110-120 : '''You can either choose to stay in Magma a bit more or move up to '''Juperos''' and '''Rachel Sanctuary F1''', both are pretty good place to mob, though Juperos has a lot of people in it.

'''Level 120-130 :''' Like before you can continue up a bit on the previous places I mentioned or move up to to the '''Scaraba Hall''', The second floor might be a bit hard at first and it's recommended you try the first. You also have to keep watch of the '''Queen Scaraba''' that spawns around.

'''Level 130-140 :''' Staying in the Scaraba hall and continuing to level via the boards and Gramps can be the wisest option at this point. You can also go to '''Bio Labs F1 and F2''', but it's quite hard if you're not experienced.

'''Level 140-175 : '''At this point you can do a lot of instances and '''Verus dailies '''at [[Phantasmagorica]] as they give a lof of experience and the monsters are easy to deal with with most Rebel skills. Instances, MvPs and high level dungeons will be the bulk of your experience and the pinnacle of your abilities and your understanding of the whole class. You can continue to solo the Eden boards, but at this point you'll get more experience by partying with other people.
