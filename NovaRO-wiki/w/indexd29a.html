Hello, and Welcome!! Too MaaChan's Axe Mechanic Guide!

This class has been my favorite for years, it is the top reason I keep on coming back to this game, and I hope it is of some use to you.

This guide will be focusing on an affordable/approach to the PVE/Farming aspect of the Mechanic class

IMPORTANT!!!: Do not think that you can only ChopChop/BoomBoom with your axe on PvE, geared well and with good knowledge PvP, MvP Hunting and Instance Farming is very possible.

== Why? - Overview ==
Because throwing an Axe is cool. And big robots are ugly.[[File:Mecha.png|left|frameless|118x118px]]
==== '''What is this Build for?''' ====
* Leveling
* Farming Zeny
* Farming items
* Hunting Low-Mid level MVP
* Completing low level instances

These are just some considerations. It's your decision at the end. This class is "newplayer" friendly and "oldplayer" loved. With the right equipment it is very viable and useful with low effort/investment required.

== Stats - What are they good for? ==

=== STR ===
How else are you going to pick up your axe?

STR is one of your primary stats, giving you ATK and increasing your Weight Limit (Axes are Heavy). When you using Axe Boomerang you are going to need both of those as high as you can.

=== AGI ===
Not useless, it gives you very usefull Flee, Soft DEF, reduces animation delay. It's not bad, but in this build we are going to be avoiding it.

=== VIT ===
Very Very important stat. It will give you very necessary MaxHP, resistance to several statuses, SoftDEF, MDEF and it will increase the damage of your Axe Tornado.

=== INT ===
If you had extra points you would increase this even more. This is a very important skill, but since it will not increase your damage or survivability it will stay behind just like AGI. Increasing INT will give you much need MaxSP and SP recovery and resistance to some statuses. 

=== DEX ===
You do have to aim your axe. DEX will give you Hit, it will give you some ATK, and it will increase your chances of success when you are forging weapons as a Blacksmith, and i say forging not refining, keep in mind refining chances are increased by your Job LvL. Overall DEX is a priority in your build.

=== LUK ===
Yes, yes and yes (3 yes for a reason ;]). Once you reach 120 STR it will be costing you 36 stat points to increase it to 121, that is a way to much, Every 3 points of LUK will give you 1 ATK... easy math, just pump it. once you finish increasing STR you can start increasing your ATK with LUK. Important to mention LUK will give you perfect dodge, Hit, Resistance to status effects and this is also a forging stat, it will increase your forging success.

== Skills - What are they good for? ==

=== Axe Skills ===
{| class="wikitable"
|[[File:Axetraining.gif|frameless]]
|'''Axe Training'''
|Yes, you do need to train. Max this skill. It will give you ATK and Hit.
|-
|[[File:Axeboom.gif|frameless]]
|'''Axe Boomerang'''
|Your primary damage output. Throws an axe at long range dealing damage and knockback. This has a pretty good range 9 cells and knockback if needed.
|-
|[[File:Axetornado.gif|frameless]]
|'''Axe Tornado'''
|Your secondary damage output. Spins an exe rapidly to cause a tornado, deals damage to all targets around the caster within the area of effect. this is a great skill for mobbing, especially when following up on a Magma Eruption. Also important to note that Axe Tornado will take the elemental type of the weapon you have.
|-
|[[File:Powerswing.gif|frameless]]
|'''Power Swing'''
|If you want to spice it up. Strikes a target with an axe dealing damage and cause stun effect. When using an axe type weapon, there is a low chance to auto-casting Axe Boomerang. It sounds like a great skill, but overall its going to be doing 1/4 of the damage you can do with with Axe boomerang with a very slow cast animation. But if you do have a target up against a wall, you could potentially do Axe boomerang and follow it up with Power Swing, and if that low chance of triggering Axe Boomerang happens you would be doing nice damage. It's not a bad skill, its just not necessary.
|-
|[[File:Researchfe.gif|frameless]]
|'''Fire Earth Research'''
|Free is good. By studying fire and earth property monsters, you increase your effectiveness and defense against these targets. Basically free ATK and Resistance to Fire and Earth elements.
|-
|[[File:Magma.gif|frameless]]
|'''Magma Eruption'''
|This is bueno. Cause Lava to erupt from the ground in the targeted cell for 5 seconds in a 7x7 area, dealing damage and inflicting stun and burning effect on the affected targets. Erupted lava lasts for 5 seconds, you can create up to 3 active Lava eruption.

This skill is quite good and at times the only reason people will want to have you when they are leveling in Gramps. It will deal a good amount of damage stun and possibly burn mobs, perfect for taking aggro for a sec while the Rangers do their thing. It has a high SP Cost, so make sure not to spam it like crazy.
|-
|[[File:Throttle.gif|frameless]]
|'''Full Throttle'''
|Free is very good. No need to explain this, It will give you that desperate boost you needed and heal you, just enough to finish off your target if needed.
|-
|[[File:Magicfaw.gif|frameless]][[File:Sniperfaw.gif|frameless]]
|'''FAW's'''
|Too FAW or not too FAW, that is the question. Silver Sniper and Magic Decoy are nice pets to have. They will do Ranged damage and Magic Damage. With your lack of Magic Damage Magic Decoy will help you out with some mobs, overall they are not necessary, But if you have have the time to invest in gathering the materials they will not hurt you in any way.
|}

== Build - How to? ==

=== Stats at level 175 ===
In order of importance, the number is BASE stat, no bonus
{| class="wikitable"
|'''STR'''
|''120''
|This is to get the max ATK you can and taking into account this build is using STR Temporal boots
|-
|'''DEX'''
|''95-?''
|This will give you high enough Hit almost everything, If you are going to be using Menblatt Card you could increase this stat up too 120.
|-
|'''VIT'''
|''89+''
|Aiming to get 100 Vit Total with any bonus you might have from equipment and job.
|-
|'''LUK'''
|''99''
|This is a pretty healthy amount, could vary, just remember to always top it in multiples of 3, since the ATK bonus is 1ATK = 3LUK
|-
|'''AGI-INT   '''
|''50-60  ''
|Basically whatever you have left, i would personally go INT over AGI, or have them both around the same amount. More INT is more SP, which means less consumables.
|}
Here is an example of what I have, without any gear on (except for a costume headgear which gives only gives +50 style):

[[File:Mechstat.png|frameless|434x434px]]

You can see my VIT is only 89+9 =98, but with my current equipment i have an extra 2 VIT, so it gets rounded up to 100.

This stat build is considering im using Wakwak Card in my garment.

The other stat variant as mentioned would be when using Menblatt Card. This will give you greater damage on your Axe Boomerang by losing some damage on your Axe Tornado and Losing Max HP.

Here is what I have without any Equipment (Except from some sweet costumes that give +99 cool)

[[File:Menblattbuild.png|frameless|676x676px]]

Here my VIT is basically what points I had left. I decided to increase my INT to get higher MaxSP allowing me to stay farming for longer.

=== Skills at level 175 ===
This is what everything look like at the end. 

'''Special notes:''' 
* We are ignoring money=damage. NO mammonite, NO HSCR. These skills will keep you poor and are unnecessary, tempting, but unnecessary.
* Ore Discovery and its requirements are just a personal preference, it's sometimes nice to get random ores while you are farming other things. Same goes for Enchanted stone Craft, just personal preference, you could totally avoid them and do whatever you want with those points.

== Equipment - What do you need? ==

Final Gear Overview: 

All equipment is considering affordable options, nothing too crazy, no +99 Refined Ragnarok Axe of Instant Win that drops 0.0000001 every full moon in a guild dungeon. Basically nothing over 3-5m to buy from other players...  

The exception being STR Temporal Boots and Sea Captain Hat. More on them when we get there. DEX Supplement part is another very fluctuating equipment in terms of price, it can go from cheap, under 4m, to expensive over 10m.  

=== Axe!!! ===
{| class="wikitable"
|{{Item  List |id=1371 |item=Doom Slayer |slots=1 |simple=yes }}
|Highest Attack/Weight for an affordable Axe, in any case I would 100% recommend this axe
|This will be your primary damage weapon. 
|Orc Lord Drop. Bought from Players
|-
|{{Item  List |id=28100 |item=Thanatos Axe |slots=1 |simple=yes }}
|Good Attack/Weight not the most cheap.
|This will be your primary farming weapon.
|Crafted in Ghost Palace.
Bought from players
|-
|{{Item  List |id=28101 |item=Tornado Axe |slots=1 |simple=yes }}
|Sweat Axe Tornado Spam &lt;3.
|This will be your primary fun weapon.

You can use it for farming, or damage, but the other options are overall better.
|Drop from Charleston 3. Bought from players
|}
Primary Cards used: '''Archer Skeleton Card / Zipper Bear Card''' - Racial Cards (abysmal knight etc etc)

Other good Axe considerations are:
* Light of Epsilon - For farming purposes in Geffenia, if you don't have the damage yet to 1 shot Incubus/Succubus with axe boomerang, this might help you. Or you could just have a priest buff you with aspersio.
* Giant Axe - If you can't get your hands on Doom Slayer, this might be an easier to get substitute, also has 15% damage on HSCR if you are into that kinda of thing.
* While leveling, the Eden Axe or a Two Handed Axe with some ATK cards could be great. 

=== Shield? ===
No, let your axe be your shield :)

=== Headgear ===
{| class="wikitable"
|{{Item List|id = 5907|item = Sea Captain Hat|slots = 1}}
|This is your Headgear Goal, its from the cash shop, you don't need to go crazy trying to refine it. Just as is it gives you 20% increase damage on your Axe Tornado and Boomerang.
|Cash Shop Item
|-
|{{Item List|id = 5208|item = Rideword Hat|slots = 1}}
|While you work towards your sea captain hat and Thanatos Axe, Rideword will give you some sustain when farming. Not bad at all. Good to sell once you are done using it.
|Quest Headgear
|-
|{{Item List|id = 5760|item = Driver Band|slots = 1}}
|When you start your life as a Mechanic, this will be your starting headgear, its a great one, once you get the 120 STR requirement it will give you some ATK that will go a long way. 
|Acquired on job change
|}
Primary card used: '''Dark Pinguicula Card / Marduk Card''' (This can be really useful when dealing with mobs that silence you).

=== Armor ===
{| class="wikitable"
|{{Item List|id = 15110|item = STR Supplement Part}}
|There is no going around it, you will need this armor set. It is what will make this build viable. 100% Increased damage on Axe Boomerang when equipped with Dex Supplement Part... 100%. yes 100%.
|Bought in verus for 3,999,999 zeny
|-
|No other option
|Its not worth it to spend your precious zeny on anything else, save up!
|
|}
Sadly no cards here. While leveling, if you have to get an armor, and it happens to have a slot, Porcellio Card does great stuff :)

=== Garment ===
{| class="wikitable"
|{{Item List|id = 20732|item = VIT Supplement Part|slots = 1}}
|Make your gear match!!! 25% Increased damage on Axe Tornado when equipped with the STR Supplement. This is a farming build, and Axe Tornado will help you at clearing mobs when surrounded.
|Verus Equipment Exhange/bought from players
|-
|Maybe another option?
|The damage increase is not crazy like the Dex Supplement Combo making it a bit less desirable. If you must use any other gear, just remember to look for garments that would increase your ATK.
|
|}
Primary cards used: '''Menblatt Card / Wakwak Card'''

Here you have room to decide and meaningfully change Stats in your build. Menblatt will require you increase your DEX to get even higher damage from your Axe Boomerang. Wakwak keeps in the STR build. I suggest you take in consideration what cards you have available and cards can you afford to buy or farm at the moment.

Wakwak will be easier to farm, taking into consideration that wakwaks are Demon/Shadow 2 and take 150% damage form holy damage and you can get aspersio for your axe, or use Light Epsilon.

=== Boots ===
{| class="wikitable"
|{{Item List|id = 22006|item = Temporal Str Boots|slots = 1}}
|The ones with ATK! You are taking STR to 120, you can't go wrong with these.
|OGH Crafting
|-
|{{Item List|id = 2408|item = Shackles}}
|While you get your Temporals and your accessories, these are not too hard to get, but will require the combo.
|Dropped from Zerom/Zombie Prisoner
|}
Primary cards used: 

'''Gold Acidus Card''' For the MaxHP/SP

'''Sohee Card''' For the MaxSP, allowing you to lower your INT

=== Accessories ===
{| class="wikitable"
|{{Item List|id = 2995|item = DEX Supplement Part|slots = 1}}
|Just like the STR supplement there is no going around it. This will be one of the most expensive items in your build. Save up!
You could hope to get the drop from the instance, or verus exchange system. I would recommend you buy it from players, you need this ASAP!
|Verus Equipment Exhange/bought from players
|-
|{{Item List|id = 2655|item = Bloodied Shackle Ball}}
|Combo with Shackles
|Baphomet Drop/bought form players
|-
|{{Item List|id = 2923|item = STR Glove|slots = 1}}
|The quest is long! But its worth it. Keeping the STR Theme of the build, These will give you a nice boost on ATK. Just do the quest, don't buy them from players. You need your zeny for the Supplement Parts.
|Splendid Coin Exchange /bought from players
|}
While leveling, any accessory that gives you STR or ATL is good.

Primary cards used:

'''Mantis: '''For extra STR, cheap way to get ATK

'''Creamy: '''To save on fly wing

'''Gold Scaraba: '''To wreck face :). Expensive Card. Not completely necessary, but its a good thing to aim at when optimizing the build.

== Leveling ==

=== Merchant ===
Increase your Stats in the following order of priority DEX-> STR-> AGI->VIT. Aiming to get around 30-50 Dex/Str/AGI Before you invest in Vit.

Go ahead and choose your poison, pick any route you want for leveling, around level 30+ I would recommend you go to Toy Factory, There are alot of good items to sell and make some good zeny. (Cake, Pearls, etc).  

Another good place is Orc Dungeon. 

Try and fill up your Cart ASAP to use Cart Termination at its highest damage. I usually just buy all the Phracon i can from the Blacksmiths in Prontera.

=== Blacksmith/Whitesmith ===
Increase your Stats in the following order of priority STR-> DEX-> VIT-> AGI. or STR->DEX-> AGI->VIT. Aiming to get around 70 Dex 90+STR and what ever amount of Vit and Agi you prefer.

Example Build at Level 99:
{| class="wikitable"
|'''STR'''
|''90''
|-
|'''AGI'''
|70
|-
|'''VIT'''
|30

The Best way to level is by following the Eden Quests. Look up the wonderful guides that NovaWiki provides. They will help you get a nice starting equipment and set you up for Gramps! once you are level 85+. Follow the INSTANT third Job Guide. Read carefully on how to deliver quests and when!.

-During Gramps 85+ You are best at luring mobs. Since you many classes you are speeding through trying to get to your 3rd Class, you wont have the best of gear, your damage will be low compared to what Rangers and other DPS classes will have, but alas!.. don't just Autofollow! Use Cart Revolution to Lure mobs for your party, it has a nice aoe and its easy to use.

=== Mechanic! ===
Increase your Stats in the following order of Priority VIT-> STR-> DEX-> LUK-> INT.

You are here!!! Get your gear!!! You need to prioritize getting STR and DEX supplement parts. Good places to Farm Zeny when low level are Toy Factory and you can start and trying your luck on Geffenia, a.k.a. Zeny Heaven.

-During Gramps 115+ And 145+ You are best at luring and stunning mobs. Again for party purposes while leveling, Rangers will have the damage in the party. Here your best job would either to Tank and lure for the party luring mobs with Axe Boomerang or to Stun the mob that the dedicated tank brought to you, via Magma Strike!. *Careful with spamming this skill it has a high sp cost for you.

=== '''Mechanic Level 175''' ===
CONGRATS!!! You did it!. You are now max level, now what?

'''Farming Zeny and Items'''

Always remember to bring:
* 1x Thanatos Axe
* 200+ Fly Wing, or Your Creamy Card.
* And if Needed Enchanting Scrolls to change the element of your Weapon.
Always remember to:
* Set your @autoloot
* Set your @alootid +theitemyouwant
* Remember you can make lists and save them, for example you could have an aloot list saved for farming at Geffenia, one for Farming Oridecon in Glast Heim, etc etc.
* Remember to be efficient, don't waste SP killing every single mob you can, kill single monsters. If you are surrounded Hit Magma Eruption + Axe Tornado. Or just fly wing away.
'''Hunting MvP'''

Remember to bring:
* Highest Damage Axe (Kingbird Doom Slayer)
* Emergency Pots/Berry
* And if Needed Enchanting scrolls to change the element of your Weapon.
Remember to:
* Set your @autoloot
* Clear the mvps minions with Magma Eruption + Axe Tornado
* Research what's the best element to hit the MvP with.
* BE QUICK!!! MvPs are free for all, and you are not the only one that wants them.

== Other stuff... ==

=== Geffenia &lt;3 ===
Zeny Heaven &lt;3 Geffenia, you will learn to love it, or maybe its a hallucination... Get it ;D? You will...

Geffenia Dungeon is a map where Incubus and Succubus spawn. They drop the following items of interest:
* '''Flower Huuma Shuriken'''
* '''Gold Ring'''
* '''Diamond Ring'''
* '''Mastela Fruit'''
Selling this items to NPC (with Overcharge Maxed) will get you great profit. You are looking at, if done correctly, 2,000,000 zeny in about just 20-30min.

The best map would be gefenia03, which has more Incubus spawning than the other maps.

The worst part of Geffenia is False Angels, which may and probably will cast Hallucination on you, an annoying skill which will flip your screen upside down for an annoying duration. BUT if you keep calm, it's not that bad. Just keep in mind that When your screen is flipped the HitBox of the mobs change a bit, or rather stay as if your screen never changed, so you might need to aim to click below their base.

Incubus/Succubus have under 18,000 HP. And take 175% extra damage from holy element. So bring Light Epsilon Axe will help you bring your damage up if you aren't there yet.
