Hi! This is an EXTREMELY WIP guide to BG, or Battlegrounds in NovaRO. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to just edit the page, thanks! ^^

== Overview ==
This is a overall guide to [[Battlegrounds]], a collection of team-based PvP games. Anyone level 190 or higher can join by being in a town or BG waiting room, and typing @joinbg into the chat box.

== Stats ==
Although your statspread will vary depending on what class you're playing, it's good to know what investing into each stat will give you. Keep in mind that you need 120 of a stat to utilize that stat's Temporal Boots, and 110 of the stat to use that stat's Glove.
*'''STR''' - Carrying capacity (helps to resist Shadow Chasers' Masquerade skills), ATK (gives more ATK to melee weapons than ranged). Reduces duration of being stuck in a Sorcerer's Vacuum Extreme.
*'''AGI''' - Increases ASPD, FLEE. 100 AGI gives immunity to Sleep, Bleeding. AGI also helps resist Shadow Chasers' Masquerade skills. Soft defense (flat reduction on physical damage)
*'''VIT''' - Increases MHP, healing item effectiveness (important since most healing will be coming from potions), soft DEF and MDEF (flat reduction on physical and magic damage, respectively). 100 VIT gives Stun immunity.
*'''INT''' - Increases MSP, MATK, SP recovery item effectiveness. 100 INT gives silence immunity. Helps reduce Variable Cast Time (VCT).
*'''DEX''' - Helps reduce Variable Cast Time (VCT) more effectively than INT. Increases ATK (gives more ATK to ranged weapons than melee).
*'''LUK''' - Increases Perfect Dodge. Reduces time spent in Warlocks' White Imprison (when cast by enemies) and chance of getting affected by Genetics' Mandragora Howling.


== Classes ==
This is a brief overview of every class that is available for Battlegrounds. If you're deciding which class you want to try, you can find a quick description of each class's role over here. More nuanced details for each class and non-standard roles will not be provided, for the sake of brevity. You can take a look at specific [[Class Guides]] to more in-depth information about each class.

Keep in mind that most classes play differently than the builds that they normally use in PVM or WOE game modes. Battlegrounds has a large focus on individual play, so builds that are more self-sufficient (ie, does not rely on Minstrel's {{Skill List|id=321|skill=A Poem of Bragi}}, does not require Arch Bishop buffs, etc.) will be more effective. You should still know how to take advantage of proper support when your team has the right members, but do not create a build with support as a given.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3runeknight.png]] [[Rune Knight]] ''' ===

Rune Knights can deal immense physical single-target melee burst damage via {{Item List|id=12726|item=Crush Strike}}, though they no longer need to use {{Skill List|id=61|skill=Auto Counter}} due to critical being enabled in pvp, making the job have a high AoE damage with {{Skill List|id=313|skill=Ignition Break}}, {{Item List2 |id=12732 |item=Storm Blast |simple=yes}} and a powerful single target long-ranged skill on {{Skill List|id=2002|skill=Sonic Wave}}.

Rune Knights also don't need to sacrifice their survivability for power, resulting in strong tanks that can one-shot most enemy players every 30 seconds when Crush Strike's cool down is up. They can also make use of {{Skill List|id=2009|skill=Dragon Howling}} to lock opponents down so they can run next to them to strike, or use {{Skill List|id=2003|skill=Death Bound}} to reflect enemy melee attackers. Aside from their melee prowess, they can provide several powerful self-buffs using runes created from {{Skill List|id=2010|skill=Rune Mastery}}.

Alternatively, Rune Knights can use {{Skill List |id=2008 |skill=Dragon Breath|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=5004 |skill=Dragon Breath - Water|simple=yes}} to do AoE Ranged damage. This skill can only be spammed if you have a Minstrel buffing you with {{Skill List|id=321|skill=A Poem of Bragi}}, since stacking ACD gear is not recommended. This skill isn't affected by your ATK, and only increases based on your current HP, max SP, and ranged damage modifiers.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:Pticon_3royalguard.png]] [[Royal Guard]]''' ===

Royal Guard's defining ability is to protect allies through {{Skill List|id=255|skill=Devotion}}. For game modes which require carrying objectives, the importance of Devotion cannot be understated. They can also protect any heavy damage based class and allow them to survive longer, which gives them more time to destroy the enemy team. {{Skill List|id=257|skill=Defender|simple=yes}} will let you reduce ranged damage so much it'll become negligible, and this also extends to players that you use Devotion on. {{Skill List|id=2312|skill=Pinpoint Attack|simple=yes}} at different levels will allow you to remove a Sura's Spirit Spheres or break other players' equipment. {{Skill List|id=2309|skill=Trample|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List|id=2323|skill=Earth Drive|simple=yes}} will allow you to clear Ground-based traps. Without a shield, Royal Guards lose a lot of their defensive buffs such as Autoguard, Reflect Shield, and Defender. {{Skill List|id=369|skill=Gospel|simple=yes}} will allow you to clear many negative (but also positive) status effects on yourself as well.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:Pticon_3warlock.png]] [[Warlock]] ''' (NOT UP TO DATE) ===

Warlocks can build highly offensive or defensive, and can hybridize between depending on their skill choices and gearing. Offensive Warlocks are generally extremely frail, but can deal heavy magic-based damage. They have powerful single-target burst with {{Skill List|id=2217|skill=Tetra Vortex}}, which also allows them to switch or mix elements when an enemy is resisting a specific element. With proper gearing, a barrage of {{Skill List|id=2211|skill=Crimson Rocks}} and/or {{Skill List|id=2213|skill=Comets}} launched rapidly through {{Skill List|id=2231|skill=Reading Spell Book}} and {{Skill List|id=2230|skill=Release}} can deal a great amount of area magic damage. Be wary with Crimson Rock usage as you can break enemies out of Crystallize. Finally, the damage Warlock's ace skill is {{Skill List|id=5012|skill=Intense Telekinesis}}, which will turn {{Skill List|id=2202|skill=Soul Expansion}} into a lethal magic machine gun. It has a long cool down, so use it to secure a victory or to turn a tide.

A supportive Warlock will instead focus on disabling and controlling enemy players. {{Skill List|id=2203|skill=Frost Misty}}, {{Skill List|id=2204|skill=Jack Frost}} and {{Skill List|id=2207|skill=Sienna Execrate}} are all powerful area skills that can slow or halt a group of adversaries. {{Skill List|id=2201|skill=White Imprison}} followed by {{Skill List|id=2205|skill=Marsh of Abyss}} is a great skill combination to escape from an enemy, or to set them up for other members of your team to kill. {{Skill List|id=2216|skill=Earth Strain}} can strip equipment from a stack of enemies and is one of the few skills that can strip accessories. Finally, the support Warlock's ace skill is {{Skill List|id=2209|skill=Stasis}}, which can lock an entire enemy team's skill usage. Be aware it affects yourself and allies as well, so the best position is when you're on your own and surrounded by enemies.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3sorcerer.png]] [[Sorcerer]]''' ===

As with Warlock, Sorcerer can also play offensively or defensively and hybridize between through efficient gear swapping. Arguably their most notable skill is {{Skill List|id=2447|skill=Diamond Dust}}, which can Crystallize a stack of enemies and leave them unable to use items, skills or move, setting them up for a barrage of AoE skills in {{Skill List|id=2449|skill=Psychic Wave}}, {{Skill List|id=2446|skill=Earth Grave}} and {{Skill List|id=2454|skill=Varetyr Spear}}. {{Skill List|id=2455|skill=Arrullo}} is another option for enemy stack lockdown if Diamond Dust is resisted or blocked. Sorcerers are also very survivable and can make use of {{Skill List|id=12|skill=Safety Wall}} and {{Skill List|id=404|skill=Wall of Fog}} to prevent damage from many sources.

They are one of the game's most useful disrupters, with {{Skill List|id=289|skill=Dispel}} to remove enemy buffs (and debuffs from allies), {{Skill List|id=2450|skill=Killing Cloud}} for enemy cast interruption, {{Skill List|id=405|skill=Spider Web}} for single-target movement lock down, {{Skill List|id=375|skill=Soul Burn}} for a fast skill block, and {{Skill List|id=288|skill=Land Protector}} to clear ground effects and to block most ground-based skills. With Land Protector, keep in mind the location of your allied field effects and take care not to remove them with it unless totally necessary. In addition, you may also use {{Skill List|id=277|skill=Spell Breaker}} to stop the enemy from casting any skill. This is useful when it comes to enemies who are continuously using a skill with a significant casting time

Sorcs can also enhance their effects via their elemental spirits. Commonly chosen effects include Lv2 Aqua's increase to Crystallize chance from Diamond Dust, or Lv1 Ventus' increase to movement speed and fixed cast time decrease. The elemental spirit also provides a panic button in {{Skill List|id=5008|skill=Elemental Shield}} which can save your team from a wipe if timed correctly.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:Pticon_3mechanic.png]] [[Mechanic]] (NOT UP TO DATE) ''' ===

A potent tanking support class with several utility options. Their ace skill is {{Skill List|id=2267|skill=Self Destruction}}, which sacrifices all their SP and their Mado Gear to deal heavy area damage that can instantly kill most targets. Self Destruction can be used as a game changer, either to ensure victory or to stage a come back. 

Neutral Barrier
Stealth Field
Magnetic Field
Cold Slower
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3genetic.png]] [[Genetic]]''' ===

Genetic has a great support skill in {{Skill List|id=479|skill=Full Chemical Protection}},an AoE damage skill in {{Skill List|id=2477|skill=Cart Cannon}}, which can be combined with {{Skill List|id=2481|skill=Spore Explosion}} to deal more damage, and many different disruptive and control skills.

{{Skill List|id=2492|skill=Howling of Mandragora}} will add fixed cast time to every skill of enemies affected, even their instant cast skills, which will hamper their ability to make any responses. {{Skill List|id=2483|skill=Crazy Weed}} can destroy many land effects, including Pneuma, Mechanic's Neutral Barrier and even the Sorcerer's Land Protector. 

Genetics also have access to great movement disruption abilities, such as {{Skill List|id=5003|skill=Illusion Doping}}, {{Skill List|id= 2479|skill=Thorn Trap}} , and homunculus skills like {{Skill List|id=8043|skill=Volcanic Ash (Dieter)}} and {{Skill List|id=8019|skill=Needle of Paralysis (Sera)}}
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3ranger.png]] [[Ranger]] (NOT UP TO DATE) ''' ===

Ranger has great opportunities to shine in Battlegrounds, as Pneuma effects are never guaranteed for the enemy team. Their classic combination of {{Skill List|id=5002|skill=Unlimit}} boosted {{Skill List|id=2233|skill=Arrow Storm}} can completely wipe enemy stacks and decide team fights very early on. Even without Unlimit, Arrow Storm can still be threatening with the proper equipment and combined with a teammate's burst damage skills. They also protect themselves by staying in {{Skill List|id=2247|skill=Camouflage}} every moment where they aren't attacking.  Rangers are also great at trapping, being able to flood chokepoints with {{Skill List|id=117|skill=Ankle Snare}} or selective locations with {{Skill List|id=2238|skill=Electric Shocker}}.
&lt;br>&lt;br>

=== ''' [[File:Pticon_3minstrel.png]] [[Minstrel]] &amp; [[File:Pticon_3wanderer.png]] [[Wanderer]] ''' ===
==== '''[[File:Pticon_3minstrel.png]] [[Minstrel]]''' ====


The most important songs and buffs a minstrel should get for battlegrounds are {{Skill List|id=321|skill=A Poem of Bragi}} (this one is very demanded among all the dps jobs because of the aftercast delay reduction). {{Skill List|id=5007|skill=Frigg's Song}} &amp; and {{Skill List|id=2431|skill=Lerad's Dew}} (both are very useful for tank and dps who relies in hp like tiger cannon sura and dragon breath rune knight).  {{Skill List|id=2434|skill=Unlimited Humming Voice}} (especially for magic dps like warlocks, dps performers and oboro/kagerou). {{Skill List|id=2383|skill=Harmonize}} &amp; {{Skill List|id=2382|skill=Echo Song}} (Hamonize will reduce all stats by 30 to the target and the caster, is useful for breaking instant cast on enemies and reducing masquerade chance for shadow chasers. Def is not really important nowadays since most of the dps inside battlegrounds pierce/ignore def due to skills or gears but is very needed to remove Harminze side effects on allies and the user). {{Skill List|id=2425|skill=Gloomy Day}} &amp; {{Skill List|id=2419|skill=Poem of Netherworld}} (Gloomy is a strong and very useful skill for disabling a single target, prioritize this one for shadow chasers, sorcerers or enemy dps like warlocks, poem is very useful for trap and snare enemies).

{{Skill List|id=313|skill=Invulnerable siegfried}} (gives elemental resist which is good against some elemental dps, you will need
to be in the same team with a wanderer at least).

{{Skill List|id=2431|skill=Metallic Sound}} &amp; {{Skill List|id=2414|skill=Reverberation}} (Mellatic sound is the current meta and strongest damage skill for performers but at the same time is expensive to gear, is locked to force neutral, single target and ranged is kinda short compared to reverberation. Reverberation
is an elemental magic damage skill with a long-range, isn't so strong compared to metallic sound but
still useful for killing not tanky dps like guillotine cross, warlocks, oboro/kagerou and performers).

==== '''[[File:Pticon_3wanderer.png]] [[Wanderer]] ''' ====

Wanderer skills are more specific in terms of use, the most important song is {{Skill List|id=2350|skill=Swing Dance}} (this one is very useful because provides a big boost for the aspd of the owner and allies, which is needed for reducing skill animation and improving spam rate).
{{Skill List|id=330|skill=Service for you}} and  {{Skill List|id=329|skill=Fortune Kiss}} (Service provides an increment of sp and consumption reduction, is very useful for builds that needs a high sp pool or skills that consumes high amount of it like metallic sound. Fortune kiss privides crit rate and crit damage, very useful to buff crit dps like physical rune knights and guillotine crosses.
{{Skill List|id=1011|skill=Charming Wink}} (Is a single target debuff skill and can produce hallucination, very useful if is used in the right time).
&lt;br>The rest of the skills and explanations are shared with the minstrel guide.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
{{Skill List|id=5068|skill=Special Singer}}
(The only use is for removing fatigue after using ensemble songs like invulnerable siegfried)
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3gx.png]] [[Guillotine Cross]]  (NOT UP TO DATE) ''' ===

Cross Impact
Dark Claw
Rolling Cutter
Cross Ripper Slasher
Cloaking Exceed
Leech End
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3shadowchaser.png]] [[Shadow Chaser]]''' ===

=== '''[[File:Pticon_3archbishop.png]] [[Arch Bishop]]''' ===


Arch Bishops has an arsenal of useful support skills, such as buffs like {{Skill List|id=2041|skill=Clementia|simple=yes}}, {{Skill List|id=2042|skill=Canto Candius|simple=yes}}, {{Skill List|id=2053|skill=Expiatio|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List|id=2515|skill=Sacrament|simple=yes}}.

Aside from that, they are also capable of clearing debuffs from teammates with skills such as {{Skill List|id=72|skill=Status Recovery|simple=yes}}, {{Skill List|id=2048|skill=Lauda Ramus|simple=yes}},{{Skill List|id=2047|skill=Lauda Agnus|simple=yes}}, and {{Skill List|id=2052|skill=Clearance|simple=yes}}.

With well-timed {{Skill List|id=25|skill=Pneuma|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List|id=12|skill=Safety Wall|simple=yes}}, they can also protect themselves and their teammates from incoming damage. With a click of {{Skill List|id=5072|skill=Vituperatum|simple=yes}}, they could also drop AoE {{Skill List|id=78|skill=Lex Aeterna|simple=yes}} to make it easier for damage dealers to the enemies.

Arch Bishops, despite their image of being a full support class, could also deal considerable damage with {{Skill List|id=2040|skill=Adoramus|simple=yes}}.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
=== '''[[File:Pticon_3sura.png]] [[Sura]] ''' ===

Sura, with spheres as its main catalyst,  is the most mobile class in the game, utilizing the skill {{Skill List|id=264|skill=Snap}} to quickly move around the map. 

They have an AoE control skill {{Skill List|id=2334|skill=Cursed Circle}}, and access to dispel Minstrel &amp; Wanderer's song buffs through {{Skill List|id=2517|skill=Lion's Howl}}, which makes them a good distractor and controller. 

They also have an anti-mele single counter-attack skill {{Skill List|id=2333|skill=Crescent Elbow}} and can avoid single ranged attack with {{Skill List|id=2335|skill=Lightning Walk}}. 
&lt;br>To top it off, they also have their acolyte class skill buffs, such as {{Skill List|id=34|skill=Blessing}} and {{Skill List|id=29|skill=Increase Agility}}. 
&lt;br>Suras can also be built as a damage dealer, mostly focusing on {{Skill List|id=2330|skill=Tiger Cannon}} and {{Skill List|id=271|skill=Asura Strike}}, but it requires more gameplay/skills. 

Suras are also useful as an Emergency Caller ( {{Skill List|id=10013|skill=Urgent Call}}) in Conquest game mode due to Snap.

=== '''[[File:Pticon_2rebel.png]] [[Rebellion]]''' ===

Rebellion is a burst damage and support class with extreme mobility rivaled only by Sura. As one of the squishiest classes due to their lack of ability to wear any one-handed weapons with a shield, they must carefully use their skill {{Skill List|id=2564|skill=Fallen Angel}} to "snap" around the battlefield and utilize the skills {{Skill List|id=2554|skill=Banishing Buster}} to dispel enemy buffs and {{Skill List|id=2569|skill=Anti-Material Blast}} to reduce enemy Demi-Human resistance by 50%, vastly increasing the damage that they and their team deal to that target. &lt;br>
They are also capable of one-shotting squishy targets with their burst skill {{Skill List|id=2570|skill=Slug Shot}}. Due to its unreliable damage and lack of survivability, Rebel is only recommended to masochists and extremely advanced players.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:Pticon_0summoner.png]] [[Summoner]] ''' ===

Doram are know to be a cute class and also by many players, a useless class.
But it's completely wrong, Doram can be used as DPS with your main skill {{Skill List|id=5033|skill=Picky Peck}}, and Support with Tuna's Skills.

To complete your build, don't forget some useful skills like {{Skill List|id=5035|skill=Arclouze Dash}} who give you +40 AGI and {{Skill List|id=5040|skill= Bunch of Shrimp}} a huge boost for your ATK/MATK.

For your survival, {{Skill List|id=5022|skill=Stoop}} gonna be your favourite friend, for 6s reduce incoming damage by 90%.
Your second friend will be {{Skill List|id=5039|skill=Tuna Party}}, at lvl 5 this shield is equal to 50% of your Max HP ( Can be cast on ally ).

Two useful skills to remember, {{Skill List|id=5032|skill=Scar of Tarou}} to complete your DPS build and {{Skill List|id=5029|skill=Silverine Root Twist}}, a nightmare for some players.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:Pt_Star_Emperor.png]] [[Star Emperor]] '''  ===
Star Emperor is a mobile burst damage class that mainly focuses on the combo skills {{Skill List|id=2593|skill=Prominence Kick}} and {{Skill List|id=2592|skill=Solar Burst}}.&lt;br>
Using {{Skill List|id=214|skill=Flying Kick}} to jump to enemies, {{Skill List|id=2579|skill=New Moon Kickl}} to enter stealth to traverse the battlefield safely, {{Skill List|id=2586|skill=Book of Dimensionsl}}-augmented Advent to grant them temporary shields, and {{Skill List|id=2585|skill=Gravity Control}} to remove troublesome front-liners for 5 seconds, they specialize in assassinating classes that they have specified as their three Hatred targets.&lt;br>
They can choose to gear towards pure single-hit burst damage for deleting semi-tanky targets or invest in After-Cast Delay reduction to have a better chance of killing tanky targets.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:Pt_Soul_Reaper.png]] [[Soul Reaper]]'''  ===
Soul Reaper is a support class with limited magic damage through their skills {{Skill List|id=2602|skill=Espa}} and {{Skill List|id=2604|skill=Eswhoo}}. While Soul Linked ( {{Skill List|id=461|skill=Soul Linker Spirit}}), which they receive on spawn, they may use the skills {{Skill List|id=464|skill=Kaupe}} and {{Skill List|id=463|skill=Kaahi}} to mitigate damage taken by themselves and their opponents, {{Skill List|id=465|skill=Kaite}} to reflect magic or to increase the physical damage enemies take by 50%, or {{Skill List|id=2606|skill=Soul Division}} to increase enemies' After-Cast Delay by 50%. When faced with an unkillable tank, they can use {{Skill List|id=2610|skill=Soul Explosion}} to deal a huge portion of their max HP as fixed damage to help the team knock them down.&lt;br>
Soul Reaper is an extremely challenging class due to its need for a deep understanding of PvP in order to use Kaite without killing your own allies.
&lt;br>
&lt;br>

=== '''[[File:pticon_1supernovice.png]] [[Super Novice]] ''' ===

Ignoring their skill and gear limitations, their overall HP and SP pool is too small to withstand anything and their power output is not high enough to cause noticeable damage to most targets. While they have useful support skills in {{Skill List|id=25|skill=Pneuma|simple=yes}} and {{Skill List|id=12|skill=Safety Wall|simple=yes}}, other classes can provide the same support in addition to being able to tank hits. 
&lt;br>If you're insistent, be prepared to work your build a lot to come up with something novel and unexpected. Definitely do not try Super Novice until you've had more experience in understanding the general flow of BG.

=== Full DemiHuman Reduction ===

These are the standard gears for fully resisting the majority of other players in any PVP scenario. Most classes should always have a full reductions set available, even traditionally frail classes such as Warlock. Having a full reduction set on swap can let you resist far more attacks and either escape or counterattack.

Note for the armour, you should try to get a +6 refinement level for the extra bonuses. +9 is nice to have, but by no means mandatory when just starting a class.

=== Vellum Weaponry ===
Vellum weaponry is another family of weapons that is extremely powerful in PVP. Unlike Glorious weapons, these are good against all players (which includes Doram race) and are tradeable. These weapons are obtainable from {{Item List|id=12675|item=WoE Weapon Supply Boxes}}, which are rewarded to the winning guilds of the War of Emperiums. 
&lt;br>They are also much more limited to farm; only players of the guild which won [[War of Emperium|War of Emperium]] are allowed into the dungeons which spawn the treasure chests that drop these boxes and monsters that drop some of these weapons. In addition, two arrow quivers are also obtainable through these boxes.
&lt;br>'''These weapons have no effect outside of PvP game modes.'''
