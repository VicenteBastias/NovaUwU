== Overview ==

I'm making this guide as a way to show a different build for wanderer. As you know wanderer is a class that is mostly played as support
or better said as Service for You slave or just for the combine songs you can use with a minstrel.
Most of the time wanderer is outshine by the dances you can normally use with the minstrel leaving it to just auto-follow and have service up
or the mana song up. The reason I'm doing this is so people can besides using those songs make a wanderer that could deal a good damage
to help kill faster; of course this is '''NOT''' a build where you will be able to deal more DPS than other classes like rebel or ranger for example just
to give support in killing faster.


== Severe Rainstorm Build ==
=== Notable Skills ===
===Archer Skills===

[[File:Improve Concentration.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Improve_Concentration '''Improve Concentration''']: A great skill that boost both AGI and
DEX which are the most important stats for Severe Rainstorm.

but still inside the AoE of Severe Rainstorm.

Its damage formula comes from [{(DEX + AGI) √ó (SkillLv √∑ 5)} √ó (BaseLv √∑ 100)]%.

[[File:Swing Dance.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swing_Dance '''Swing Dance''']: Increases movement speed and ASPD. Usually a skill used mostly
when soloing as the movement speed increase will help you lure mobs and be able to do more easy Hit and Run tactics.

increases sp and gives a constant sp recovery. If used in combination with night sparrow hat reduces fixed cast time*skill level.

support skill for parties.

=== Stats ===

*'''Strength(STR)'''
Str doesn't really increases much for wanderer classes but its good to have some STR in order to increase weight limit so more arrow quivers of
different elements can be carried. If you have Gym Pass on wanderer it's completely possible to leave this stat untouched and use stats somewhere else.
Recommended 1-10.

*'''Agility(AGI)'''
Stat that increases ASPD, reduce animation delay of skills and helps both in offensive as defensive since it increases the flee rate of your character;but something that needs to be considered is that its also important in the increase of Severe Rainstorm damage since AGI belongs directly into the formula of the skill itself. 
Recommended 90-120.

*'''Vitality(VIT)'''
Increases the Max HP of your character by 1 point = 1% Max HP. Its usually recommended to have 100 VIT for Stun immunity.
Recommended 88 Base VIT +12 (job level 60). 

*'''Intelligence(INT)'''
Improves your sp pool and mostly directly affects the effect of Gypsy Kiss(Service for you) the higher Int you have the more effect of sp boost
and sp cost reduce will have. 
Recommended 90 Base INT +10 (job level 60)

*'''Dexterity(DEX)'''
Your primary stat that is used to increase your damage output. It is recommended to have at least 120 DEX to be able to use {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal DEX Boots |slots= 1 |simple=yes}}.
This stats also directly affects a lot the damage your Severe Rainstorm does.
Recommended 120.

*'''Luck(LUK)'''
Good overall stat that now increases ATK/MATK every 3 points. Also this increases the amount of crit rate that Lady Luck (Fortune Kiss) gives.
Recommended 30-50.

'''Gameplay Explanation'''
*Best way to increase the damage of this build is by building as most DEX as possible that's why {{Item List |id=4922 |item=Essence of Evil DEX3 |simple=yes}} will be mostly used it some slots in your equipment.
*[[File:Swing Dance.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swing_Dance '''Swing Dance'''] as this skill will help you with the mobility of your character. Severe Rainstorm build works mostly by kiting mobs and keeping them in the AoE while keeping yourself far from their hit range.
*[[File:Severe Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Siren's_Voice '''Siren's Voice'''] A good skill to keep mobs away from you while pulling and kiting as it will make them non-aggresive towards the user. With Voice lessons, job level and skill maxed it might reach a 80% chance of working in a 13x13 area.
*[[File:Severe Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Severe_Rainstorm '''Severe Rainstorm'''] Your main DPS skill with a 11x11 AoE and consumes 20 arrows per cast. While its effect is in place you might be able to use other skills like Arrow Shower to keep mobs inside the AoE or to push them away from you. One important point is that HawkEye affects this skill by a lot with those +200 DEX effect. For example a normal damage of 8k-10k can increase to 20k-30k if not with elemental advantage if not the increase is even more; also needs to be max level to be able to do the max damage possible as character level affects its damage.

'''Stat:'''

*'''LUK:''' 35 - Increases ATK, MATK but mostly used to not suffer from the - LUK of {{Item List |id=4922 |item=Essence of Evil DEX3 |simple=yes}}.

'''Key Equipment:'''

*{{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Best in Slot with enchants of DEX.

====Severe Rainstorm Build:====

'''Gameplay Explanation'''
*Best way to increase the damage of this build is by building as most DEX as possible that's why {{Item List |id=4922 |item=Essence of Evil DEX3 |simple=yes}} will be mostly used it some slots in your equipment.
*[[File:Swing Dance.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Swing_Dance '''Swing Dance'''] as this skill will help you with the mobility of your character. Severe Rainstorm build works mostly by kiting mobs and keeping them in the AoE while keeping yourself far from their hit range.
*[[File:Severe Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Siren's_Voice '''Siren's Voice'''] A good skill to keep mobs away from you while pulling and kiting as it will make them non-aggresive towards the user. With Voice lessons, job level and skill maxed it might reach a 80% chance of working in a 13x13 area.
*[[File:Severe Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Severe_Rainstorm '''Severe Rainstorm'''] Your main DPS skill with a 11x11 AoE and consumes 20 arrows per cast. While its effect is in place you might be able to use other skills like Arrow Shower to keep mobs inside the AoE or to push them away from you. One important point is that HawkEye affects this skill by a lot with those +200 DEX effect. For example a normal damage of 8k-10k can increase to 20k-30k if not with elemental advantage if not the increase is even more; also needs to be max level to be able to do the max damage possible as character level affects its damage.

'''Stat:'''
*'''STR:''' 1
*'''AGI:''' 120 - Gives you flee and more important its part of the formula to increase the damage of [[File:Severe Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Severe_Rainstorm '''Severe Rainstorm'''].
*'''VIT:''' 91 - Rounds up to 100 with job bonuses for stun resistance and increases your MHP.
*'''INT:''' 90 - Increases your SP pool and also affects the effectivity of your [[File:Gypsy's Kiss.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Gypsy%27s_Kiss '''Service for You'''].
*'''DEX:''' 120 - Main stat that increases Wanderer ATK, gives {{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Dex Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} bonus and its the second main stats that increase the damage of [[File:Severe Rainstorm.png]] [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Severe_Rainstorm '''Severe Rainstorm'''].
*'''LUK:''' 35 - Increases ATK, MATK but mostly used to not suffer from the - LUK of {{Item List |id=4922 |item=Essence of Evil DEX3 |simple=yes}}.

'''Key Equipment:'''
*{{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Dex Boots |slots=1 |simple=yes}} For the bonus of ranged attack 5%, +200 DEX from enchant HawkEye, and enchanted with Expert Archer.
*{{Item List |id=20718 |item=Giant Snake Skin |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Best in Slot with enchants of DEX.
*{{Item List |id=18123 |item=Bow of Storms |slots=1|simple=yes}} Best in Slot for weapon as it reduces the cooldown of your main DPS skill also increases ranged by 30%.
*{{Item List |id=18795 |item=Night Sparrow Hat |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Best in Slot as long as its refined to +7/+9 increasing the damage of Severe Rainstorm by 25% at +7 and SP cost by 50% at +9.
