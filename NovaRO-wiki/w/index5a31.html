This guide is very much a work in progress.

Hello there, my name is Rinrin and I'm proud to say I play Super Novice here on Nova RO. I'm more experienced when it comes to pre-renewal however in the time I've been here I've picked up a few tips and tricks that might help new players get stick in to the class and as the PvM side is more or less covered I decided to give some pointers for PvP.

When it comes to PvP as a super novice you have a lot of decisions to make depending on how you want to play - even more so than most classes. I'll be outlining melee builds mostly as it's what I'm most familiar with and is probably the most effective way to play the class. I might dabble in some explanations for support and caster builds later down the line if I get some more info on them.

Before we start discussing the builds I would like to make one thing very clear: You will die easily. That's not to say you can't be an asset to a WoE guild or that it will be impossible to land kills in a battleground however you will have a much harder time of it than our third job friends. For me this is what makes it fun.

== Stats ==

*'''STR''' - Used to increase melee damage. High importance for Bowling Bash build, moderate for the Crit build and low for any caster, support and most auto cast builds. Increase in carry capacity can also be nice but less important when you have a cart and other merchant skills.
*'''AGI''' - Increases attack speed and flee. One of the most important stats for just about all builds given how low your HP is and how poor your vit modifier is for increasing health pool.
*'''VIT''' - Increases your defence and health points. You always want at least a few points here, however some people prefer more than others. Personally I tend to accept I will be low health no matter how many points I put here and go for a glass cannon style build though I know many others who would rather try to offset their weakness. It comes down to preference.
*'''INT''' - Increases SP and magic attack damage. Important for caster builds or auto cast builds. Also needed for support builds. I sometimes put a few points here for melee builds as well if my focus is to spam Bowling Bash, though potions normally mean this isn't needed.
*'''DEX''' - Slight increase to attack speed and increase in hit. Also decreases variable cast speed. You'll normally have at least 80 points here depending on build.
*'''LUK''' - Increases Crit rate as well as giving you the chance of perfect dodge. Also a minor boost to Attack, magic attack, and hit. Depending on build and equipment this could rane anywhere from around 40 to 120. It does a lot so it's usually worth having at least a few points in it.

== Skills ==
As a Super Novice you have a very wide variety of skills - more so than any other class. It can be a little daunting at first however there are some that will pretty much always be a must get and others that will be kept away from. Many also fill niche roles which can be very handy at times. 

=== Super Novice ===
Use our [[Template:Skill List]] in this section.

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"

== Equipment ==
I recommend using our [[Template:Item List]] for linking items. The template automatically parses the thumbnail of the item, and creates a link to Divine Pride.

For cards, see [[Template:Card]]

Recommended format:

== Builds ==
As I mentioned previously, we have a very wide pool of builds to choose from as Super Novice and the funnest part is that there's so many options within each build that you will rarely have the same as someone else.

In this guide I will be focusing on the following builds as these are what I have experience with:

Crit/Attack Speed - focus on Luk and aspd to kill your enemy quickly with auto attacks.

Bowling Bash - Focus on maxmising strength and melee power to take people out in a few hits.

Autocast/Attack Speed - Use your attack apeed to auto cast spells without having to deal with cast time.
=== Critical / Attack Speed Build ===
----
This build relies on high amounts of crit and aspd to deal high melee damage very fast. This is one of the highest damage builds and can easily melt your enemies in a matter of seconds if they lack the right equipment or are unprepared. 

The great thing about this is that you can easily get 100% crit thanks to Fury granting +50%. As a result you can choose whether to get Temporal Boots of Luck for the 30% extra crit damage or to spend more points in Strength to boost your damage using Temporal Boots of Strength. Both are valid options though Temporal Boots of Luck are cheaper and easier to get hold of if you're impatient or poor.
==== Stats ====
This varies depending on the boots you chose as well as whether you like to play as a glass cannon (like me) or if you would rather have more health. Just try things out and see what feels right.

*'''STR''' 70-120 (try 90 if you have HBP, 120 if you have temporal str boots)
*'''AGI''' 120 (aspd is a must for this build. Very import ant to get that 193 aspd and agi is the way you do that.)
*'''VIT''' 30-90 (I run on the lower end of this to focus on damage but others have gone more defensive with great success. If you have the points and a HBP thrm getting 90 can be worth it)
*'''INT''' 1 (You don't really cast spells aside from to buff yourself.)
*'''DEX''' 60-80 (As critical hits don't miss you don't need too much dex. You'll also have plenty of extra from other equips and buffs so it's mostly just to get a little extra aspd)
*'''LUK''' 70-120 (Your goal is to get 100% crit self buffed. This will be guaranteed if you use Temporal Luck Boots and put it to 120, though if you take Temporal Boots of Strength instead you will probably only want to put enough points in to reach that 100%.)

==== Skills ====
==== Equipment ====
List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for said build.
==== Strategy ====
This build doesn't require too much work during the fight as it's mostly based on dealing high damage with your basic attacks.

I will typically buff myself with Blessing, Increase Agility, and Attention Concentrate, as well as any food buffs which will help. I may then stealth up to my target if I want to get the jump on them and open attack.

It's not uncommon to take out squishier targets before thry can react as you can often deal ~35k-40k damage in a single second with this.

=== Bowling Bash Build ===
----
This build uses Meteor Strike and 10 points in Sword Mastery to deal high damage using Bowling Bash. It deals reasonable damage and knocks the target back (which can be both good and bad, depending on the situation and you opponent). 
==== Stats ====
The stats are a little more linear here than the previous build however there is still some flexability depending on how you like to play it.

*'''STR''' 120
*'''AGI''' 70-100 (aspd doesn't matter too much but the flee can still be handy and it lets you spam bowling bash a little more)
*'''VIT''' 60-90 (I run on the lower end of this to focus on damage but others have gone more defensive with great success. If you have the points and a HBP thrm getting 90 can be worth it)
*'''INT''' 1-30 (You don't want to invest too many points here as you will mostly use potions if you need to recover sp.)
*'''DEX''' 90-100 (Ensures you have enough hit to deal with the more slippery enemies like Guillotine Cross.)

* '''LUK''' 70+ (This is mostly to get extra attack and a bit more hit as it gets quite expensive to put poibts in str over 120.)

====¬†Skills ====

==== Equipment ====
List of the '''key pieces''' of equipment recommended for said build.

==== Strategy ====
As you would guess, the main stratergy here is to smack people around using Bowling Bash. When you're fully geared you can hit up to 10k with this on lesser enemies. While this mighr not sound like a whole lot compared to some other jobs, it's pretty good for a Super Novice.

A trick that can work against some classes is to smack them away with Bowling Bash, use stealth, and walk up to them and hit them again. Against targets with high flee you can use something like Frost Nova to freeze them, so long as they're not immune to freeze.

=== Auto Cast / Attack Speed ===
----
This build relies on high amounts of crit and aspd to deal high melee damage very fast. This is one of the highest damage builds and can easily melt your enemies in a matter of seconds if they lack the right equipment or are unprepared. 

The great thing about this is that you can easily get 100% crit thanks to Fury granting +50%. As a result you can choose whether to get Temporal Boots of Luck for the 30% extra crit damage or to spend more points in Strength to boost your damage using Temporal Boots of Strength.

*'''STR''' 70-120 (try 90 if you have HBP, 120 if you have temporal str boots)
*'''AGI''' 120 (aspd is a must for this build. Very import ant to get that 193 aspd and agi is the way you do that.)
*'''VIT''' 30-90 (I run on the lower end of this to focus on damage but others have gone more defensive with great success. If you have the points and a HBP thrm getting 90 can be worth it)

== Gameplay ==
Class specific tips and tricks, such as certain skill mechanics and special roles in certain environments. 

'''For example:''' Warlock's spellbook mechanics and Kage/Oboro's charms, different weapon types and their uses for Rebellions

== Leveling ==
Leveling a super novice isn't the funnest of things. You're relatively powerless in comparison to other monsters in your level range so you'll mostly have to take your time killing monsters and avoid pulling more than two at a time in most cases. It'll take a while to kill each enemy so experience won't be very fast.

Ideally you'll want some equipment already to speed up the process as well as some funds for the Mamonite spam you'll be needing to level at a solid pace. If not then you can just make the most of eden gears.

Rather than follow this guide you can follow the general one here on this wiki:

=== Lv 1 - Lv 85 ===
* '''Lv 1 - Lv 45'''
** The first step of the grind. Honestly I don't think it matters too much what you do here was it will probably only be a few minutes faster to do it another way.
** When I started out I was keen to start stabbing things as soon as possible so headed to south Prontera and killed porings and lunatics. My stat points were mostly focused on Str and Dex at this point.
** I continued to kill everything on my screen as I headed east to Lunatics where I grinded for a further 15-20 minutes or so up to level 45.
* '''Lv 45 - Lv 70'''
** I've just stuck to Eden quest boards here, focusing on the hardest monsters I could kill for my level. This will vary depending on how much money you're starting with so I won't make many specific recommendations though I did find comodo dungeon quests to hunt Thara Frogs and Megalodons to work well for me.
* '''Lv 70 - Lv 85'''
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_70_-_79 Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest] in Glast Heim: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Glast Heim Churchyard before you start hunting Wraiths and Evil Druids. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Ur. You will receive your third and final set of Eden Equipment from Blacksmith Thorn in the room behind the Blue Door. Keep killing these Wraiths and Evil Druids for the quest until you're level 85 and can no longer accept it.

=== Gramps and onwards (Lv85+) ===

'''Lv 85 - Lv 114'''
* Rejoice for you can now do gramps and should see your exp rate improve a bit here as you can rely on others to help with damage. When grouping for gramps I recommend taking on the role of mobber. Put a point in Endurance and make sure you have Increase Agility buff from either yourself or your groups AB and start grabbing as many monsters as you can. Bring them back to your main group and let your Archer and Magician friends blow them up. Rinse and repeat. If you have a good team and little competition you can do it in about an hour. Gramps will be your main source of experience until you get to top level.

* '''Lv 114 - Lv 144'''
** Continue your gramps grind! If you have time in between runs then then do any Eden board quests you can. If you have money and are impatient you can even buy quest items to move the process along. Keep at it until 145 as that's when the fun really starts.
* '''Lv 145 - Lv 175'''
** This is where levels can really fly. I don't recommend this option if you don't already have spare loyalty tokens or money - new players are better off just doing gramps when they can. The better meathod which I'll explain now was first mentioned to me by Papa Sunbear so credit to him for letting me know about it, though from speaking to him about it further there's probably a few other people that beat him to it. Here's the plan:
** Complete your gramps quest but DO NOT HAND THE QUEST IN. Go upstairs and do the Hazy Forest monster board, do the Nightmare clock tower board, the bifrost tower board, the bifrost fields and if you get any of the items for the other quests, then keep hold of them.
** Here's the fun part. Use loyalty tokens to purchase a battle manual or buy one with zeny, use it and hand everything in to rocket up to lvl 175. The whole process can be done within a few hours which is pretty crazy.
