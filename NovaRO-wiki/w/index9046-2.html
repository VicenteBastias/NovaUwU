== Overview ==
Helloo, i'm [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine Ketalar] and in this guide i'll focus in the Oboro class, in a magic build only. Mostly cause it's more likely to make this become updated for only one build and cause it's the build that i play more. Note that this is a PVM guide.
This guide works for Kagerou too, except for the Oboro only skills that i find better for this build(it's only one :p), and for more builds, there's more guides in the [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Category:Class_Guides class guides] page.
This build has a great potential and there's good options for starters too, it doesn't need anything expensive and good gear needed can be easily farmed.

You can contact me at Ketalar#8368 for questions or suggestions, tag me in [https://discord.gg/8ywh6P7 NovaRO Discord], at #wiki.

== Stats ==
Basically, each stat here has a easy explanation.
*'''STR''' - Here nothing is recommended, except if you're going just to farm, str for this build has only weight purpose so i leave it in 1, and you can use Gym Pass if weight is really bothering you.
*'''AGI''' - Agi is a important factor in this build, mostly for ASPD, after we get instant cast, it allow us to cast more skills in less time, increasing DPS. Besides that, it's useful for the flee that it provides. Scale it depending on how fast you can cast, if you have insta cast already, so a high value is good.
*'''VIT''' - I don't focus on vit, even that a high value is needed for stun immunity(100 with bonus), thanks to [[File:Cicada Skin Shed.png]], after a physical attack, your character will not receive the damage and move back away from the enemy, it's more likely that you'll not get stun, it's still possible but don't worry about it. Any low to no value here is recommended.
*'''INT''' - Int is one of main stats of this build, together with agi and dex, but, the priority order is really Dex/Getting insta cast > Agi/Getting good ASPD and then INT, mostly cause, DPS means damage per second, so the first two stats will allow us to give more damage in less time, and then int will increase this damage. Basically all points that aren't in agi and dex, a minimum ~90 is good.
*'''DEX''' - Dex is the first stat to aim for, as it reduces our cast time, a high value here is needed, even dex foods are recommended.
*'''LUK''' - Basically no value for us as we have another priorities, unless you wanna share int points with luk as luk gives matk too but i would just leave it 1 too.

== Skills ==
There's only one Oboro only skill that directly helps this build, i'll talk about it first and then go to general skills.

=== Oboro Skills ===
Oboro has 3 exclusive skills, '''Distorted Crescent''' is a good buff but sometimes hard to apply until you get the practice, '''Moonlight Fantasy''' is almost impossible to apply in a pvm situation and '''Ominous Moonlight''' can be used in pvm but doesn't apply to boss monsters and it's kinda limited cause of this.

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% "| Skill
! style=" width: 70% "| Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3026 |skill=Distorted Crescent Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
|This skill is a buff, that can be used in offensive purposes, but for us, we'll only use it as a buff, if our SP is odd when we use it, our MATK will decrease and when it is even, it will increase, basically you need to be fast and control your SP regen to do this.
*I like to use it after 16th Night [[File:16th Night.png|frameless]], as the cast will be faster. One trick that i use, is the skill First Aid [[File:First Aid.png|frameless]], it casts instantly and uses 3sp, so if you current sp is odd, it will be even when using it. You get around 158 matk at level 175 using this skill in yourself as a buff.
*So use [[File:16th Night.png|frameless]] > Wait for your natural regen > If your sp is odd, cast [[File:First Aid.png|frameless]] > Cast Distorted Crescent. This need to be done really fast, or you'll get a really dangerous matk debuff and will need to wait the cd.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3027 |skill=Moonlight Fantasy Lv 3 |simple=yes}}
|This skill isn't a big deal in PVM as you can't use it in monsters, actually it's possible to duel your sura to try to increase hp, but as it has random effects, it's better to not use it, would be a situational crazy thing. 
|}

=== Main Skills ===
These skills are the best ones and both Kagerou and Oboro has them, some are from the Ninja skill tree.
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% "| Skill
! style=" width: 70% "| Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=534 |skill=Flaming Petals Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
|This is your main offensive spell, and sadly, it's not AOE, it's a fire magic attack that has 0% after cast delay with [[File:16th Night.png|frameless]], this build will increase it's damage. It gives damage equal to '''90% of your matk''', each skill level increase the number of hits by 1 but adds 0.7s to the cast time.

10 '''Fire-Charms''' increase this skill damage by 200%.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=537 |skill=Freezing Spear Lv 6~10 |simple=yes}}
|A water alternative to the first skill, it is weaker than Flaming Petals, but you need it when fighting fire creatures, it inflicts '''70% water magic damage''', starting with 3 hits and each level increases it by 1, like before, so it will be 12 hits at level 10 and the cast time increases 0.7 per level.

This skill gets 50% more damage with 10 '''Ice-Charms'''.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=540 |skill=Wind Blade Lv 3~7 |simple=yes}}
|Another skill that you'll only use if you have elemental disadvantage with both Flaming Petals and Freezing Spear too, it gives '''150% wind magic damage''' in each blade, however, some levels in this skill only changes the sp use.

With 10 '''Wind-Charms''' this skill damage increase in 200%.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3022 |skill=16th Night Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
|One of your best skills, '''keep this active''' - it's a buff that reduces your fixed cast time in 100% and your variable cast time in 50%, note that it stacks multiplicatively with another reductions, so 50% from this skill and 50% variable cast reduction from gears, will result in 75% reduction, not 100%.
It has 60 seconds cooldown, and the duration in Lv3 is 60 seconds, so it's the min level for this skill, but i go for Lv5 as it gives 90sec cooldown duration and we have another buff to keep.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3015 |skill=Fire Charm Lv 1 |simple=yes}}

{{Skill List |id=3017 |skill=Wind Charm Lv 1 |simple=yes}}

{{Skill List |id=3016 |skill=Ice Charm Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
|These charms are a kind of buff, they have about 300 seconds duration, and will increase the magic damage of some spells of its element, you need to buy them(there's a npc in prontera) to use, and cast 10 at a time.
*Ice Charm will increase Freezing Spear damage by +5% per charm and Snow Flake Drift by +25% per charm.
*Fire Charm will increase Flaming Petals damage by +20% per charm, Blaze Shield by +5% per charm and Exploding Dragon by +15% per charm.
*Wind Charm increases Wind Blade damage by +20% per charm, Lighting Jolt +15% per charm and First Wind by +10% per charm.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=531 |skill=Cicada Skin Shed Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
|A good skill to keep us alive, at level 5 it does 3 dodges of incoming attacks, after dodging, it pushes you back 7 cells, you must have it.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=535 |skill=Blaze Shield Lv 7 |simple=yes}}
|This skill lasts 20 seconds or until doing the total amount of strikes, it is really good to trigger stuff like Runaway Magic. Each strike gives '''50% fire magic damage''', it starts with 5 strikes and every 2 levels it increases one, so 9 in Lv9, different from some skills above, the cast time starts with 6 seconds and decrease at each skill level by '''0.5s'''.

With 10 '''Fire-Charms''' this skill damage increases in 50%. It requires a [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/7521/flame-stone Flame Stone] that can be bought in the Ninja Supplier NPC, see Gameplay in this guide below.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=536 |skill=Exploding Dragon Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
|One of your few AOE skills. It gives '''900% fire magic damage''' at lv5, consuming one [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/7521/flame-stone Flame Stone](See Ninja Supplier below where you can buy it).

This skill damages increases in 150% with 10 '''Fire-Charms'''.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3011 |skill=Pure Soul Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
|Pure Soul is your bread and butter, will regen your hp completely and half your sp in 10 seconds, but you're immobilized in this time,you can't walk but can use skills and skills that move yourself,
it uses 100sp so use it before it's too late, the CD is short so use it always when you have time for it and need, even if need only a bit.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=532 |skill=Mirror Image Lv 0~5 |simple=yes}}
|It's a good skill to dodge(any physical damage) but it has a lot of requirements, you still can get it if you want. You need to be using {{Skill List |id=543 |skill=Ninja Aura |simple=yes}} to cast and it consumes a [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/7524/shadow-orb Shadow Orb](again just check the NPC Ninja Supplier below).
|}

==Another Skills==
{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 30% "| Skill
! style=" width: 70% "| Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3019 |skill=Release Ninja Spell Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
|Use all charms to deal '''MATK * (200 * charm quantity) * (Base Level / 100)%''' damage, the element is the same as the element of the charms used.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=539 |skill=Snow Flake Draft |simple=yes}}
|Ice AOE that scales good with charms. It's '''350% water magic damage''' at level 5 without charms, it does damage around you and has a chance of giving the frozen status to enemies, each cast uses a [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/7522/ice-stone Ice Stone](see Ninja Supplier below).

10 '''Ice-Charms''' will increase this skill damage by 250%.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=3020 |skill=Cast Ninja Spell Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
|Creates a 5x5 in the ground that inflicts status depending in the charms
*Fire: Casts burning.
*Ice: Casts freezing.
*Wind: Casts silence, sleep and deep sleep.
*Earth: Casts stone curse and poison.
|}

== Cast Time ==

[[File:Oborocast.gif]]

The general Variable Cast formula for 0 cast here is:

DEX x 2 + INT = 530

Note that '''dex''' is multiplied by 2, so its a important stat when we talk about cast time.

As we saw in Skills, Oboro can use 16th Night [[File:16th Night.png|frameless]]  that will reduce the fixed cast time in 100%, and the variable cast time in 50%, 
so we are more likely to reach this, but keep in mind that 16th Night stacks multiplicatively with another reductions.

It's really good to use stat foods there, both int and dex foods will help in casting time.

{{Item List |id=12205 |item=Hwergelmir's Tonic |simple=yes}}(from Slot Machine) gives DEX +10, you can use it together with {{Item List |id=12432 |item=Siroma Iced Tea |simple=yes}}, that gives DEX +20 for a total of '''DEX +30'''.

For INT you can use {{Item List |id=12204 |item=Dragon Breath Cocktail |simple=yes}}(from Slot Machine) for INT +10 and {{Item List |id=12430 |item=Warg Blood Cocktail |simple=yes}} for INT +20, for a total of '''INT +30'''.

== Equipment ==
After all, Kagerou/Oboro has a limited amount of equipments for the magic build.

||5% chance to ignore magic defense when attacking for 5 seconds, for me, it's the best in slot, or at least, the best hat that we have for now, some monsters and bosses got a really high MDEF, so ignoring it is the way to go.
We are more likely to trigger the 5% chance as we can spam our skills really fast.
|-

||Replacing Wickebine's Black Cat Ears is not a good thing(unless you own some vesper cards), but this hat has one slot and can give good matk %, it's still "acceptable" for the build, but i don't recommend it, matk/int is our last focus(after cast and aspd) and you should use anything else than Wickebine's only if you have another way to deal with creatures MDEF.

||{{Item List |id=28706 |item=Vicious Mind Dagger |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
||Weapon
||Monster drop
||This can be the best in slot, as it's Lv4 it will give more matk, plus the default +50matk that this dagger got, it has 1 slot, something that isn't a real problem here, plus you can get good enchants.

Same as before, but it's a Lv4 weapon and has +50 MATK, so the formula would be '''50 + (15 * 15 / 2) + 105'''(each refine here gives 7 matk), so '''267,5 MATK'''.

|-

New note on this: The autocast can stop you from dealing a lot of damage sometimes.

These cards are only a reference, '''you don't need them''' for the build.
{| class="wikitable" style=" width: 76%"
! style=" width: 23% " | Card
! style=" width: 68%" | Notes
|-
||{{Card |id=31023 Celine Kimi Card}}
||Weapon card with MATK +10%, 0.5 chance of inflicting Critical Wound in any target 11x11 cells around, Critical Wound inflicts 100% Physical Damage and place a debuff in healing power, it would fit well with Crimson or Vicious Mind daggers as they has ATK in good refines too, the chance increases by 1% every 3 refines, so would be 5.5% in +15.
|-
||{{Card |id=4556 Fenrir card}}
||Headgear card, it would be a waste of 70% Fixed Cast Time reduction, but it gives +50 MATK and +5 MATK for every refine.
|-
||{{Card |id=4441 Fallen Bishop Hibram Card}}
||Wasting 50% damage in demihuman, but would give you +10% MATK in a footgear.
|-
||{{Card |id=4365 High Wizard Card}}
||Ignores MDEF of normal monsters, has side effects like slowing your cast time in 2x and killing your sp regeneration.
|-
||{{Item List |id=4374 |item= Vesper Card |simple=yes}}
||Headgear card that ignores 30% of boss monsters MDEF.
|}

==Shadow Gears==
Shadow Gears can be obtained in [[Monster Hunter]], they equip in the costumes area(but you can still use costumes, even the garment one) and each set gives different stats.

The recommended sets are DEX, that gives '''dex +5''' and '''cast time -5%''', agi for '''agi +5''' and '''aspd +5%''' and int for '''int +5''' and '''matk +5'''.

==Pets==
The bonus only applies when the pet is loyal, for more info see [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Pet_System Pet System].

|-

|-
||{{Item List |id=9048 |item=Am Mut |simple=yes}}
||Matk +4%, a good % matk boost to increase your general damage.
|}

== Builds ==

=== Stats ===
Before was said everything needed and the explanation of the stats, keep in mind that the best thing to do, is to balance your stats depending in your needs.

==== Starter Build ====
If you're using the basic items recommended here, and no end game gear, an approach like this is good:

*'''STR''' 1
*'''AGI''' 90
*'''VIT''' ~96
*'''INT''' 120
*'''DEX''' 120
*'''LUK''' 1
Still has some points, as a newbie, it can be hard to get instant cast, so we can bring more vit here.
For end game builds, the stats need to be balanced by your needs, just follow the stats explanation in the guide start.

=== Skill Build ===
*Mostly main skills already has a recommended level said before, there's another useful skills so beside that ones, you can be free with your skill points.
*If you wanna get Mirror Image, you can use a skill tree like this:
[[File:Mirrorimage-tree.png]]
*Note that exploding dragon is there for the often uses of the fire charm, you can sacrifice Mirror Image and its required skills to put more points in the magic branch, in general, you can adapt both ninja and oboro skills as you want, keeping the essential.

=== Strategy ===
*Focus on casting Flaming Petals after having all buffs set.
*Keep distance from mobs and keep in touch with Cicada Skin Shed dodges left.

== Farming Tips ==

[[File:Oborofarming.png]]

Basic tips to get zeny as a oboro! To make your life easier, first max your character using the leveling guide, then you can farm.
*If you're really just starting the game, you can get a small amount of zeny in Toy Factory, to buy the basics, but this if you're not maxed and can't handle another places.
*Between Juperos, Magma Dungeon 2 and Geffenia, '''Geffenia''' is better for us, as we don't have a good AOE skill and its more easy to survive.
*You can get a daily profit doing [[Ghost Palace]], it's a easy instance that you can do solo.
*Charleston is a good easy instance for our job, Old Glast Heim too.
*You can do [[Banquet for Heroes]] dailies to get [[Honor Token]], here you can get your Flattery Robe or get them to sell.
*You can do a Mins and auto follow you in some instances, in it, you would need dex.

=== More farming places ===

So if you don't like Geffenia or just got tired of grinding in the same place, there's more places to get zeny.

*Daily profit:
[[Mora Daily Quests]] can give a nice daily profit, you can get one WWS every 2 days, you need to do [[Mora Village]] quest first.

As said before, [[Banquet for Heroes]] if realized every day, can give a nice amount of zeny sometimes.

Ghost palace can be done to sell Thana Bows(as they sell faster).

*Places that rely on drop chance:
{{Item List |id=15042 |item=White Wing Suits |simple=yes}} - Farming WWS in Anubis at [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/map/in_sphinx4 sphinx4], it's kinda bad as they sell for low but good if you're going to refine or wanna try your lucky.

{{Item List |id=18130 |item=Crimson Bow |simple=yes}} - Farming Crimson Bow in [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/map/lhz_dun02 Bio Lab 2], Thor Volc killing [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1830/bow-master Bow Master] or Owl Baron in [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/map/tha_t06 Thanatos Tower 6], Kavach Icarus can be hard if you can't evade his attacks, Bow Master has only a few so you need to tp a lot but it drops another stuff too.

{{Card |id=4508 Gold Scaraba Card}} - If you're able to!

{{Card |id=31017 Outrageous Cookie Card}} - Same as above, but there's only a few tirant cookies.

{{Card |id=4593 Menblatt Card}} and {{Card |id=4594 Petal Card}}, these ones are in the same map and they sell fast.

{{Card |id=4054 Angeling Card}}, {{Card |id=4174 Deviling Card}} and {{Card |id=4074 Ghostring Card}} - They have a really small drop rate and spawn, so i wouldn't try to "farm" these ones, but if you're feeling lucky...

{{Item List |id=607 |item=Ygg Berry |simple=yes}} - Farming these in the last floor of Basilisk Dungeon can give some profit.

== Gameplay ==
*Remember that you can use First Aid to switch your SP from ODD to EVEN to use Distorted Crescent buff asap.
[[File:Distortedtrick.gif]]
*You can use Distorted Crescent in allies too, it's better to get the party window, and use '''@showsp''' too.
*All stuff from this job can be bought in the npc '''Ninja Supplier''' in Prontera(@go 0).
[[File:Ninjasupplier.png]]
*Always use all 10 charms for the skill that you're using, the damage boost is really needed and they last 300 seconds.
*In [[Sara's Memory]] you can get stats food that are needed for our class, mostly if you don't have insta cast, different stats food of the same stat can be used together.
*The formula for instant cast is: (dex*2 + int) = 530.
*Some skills like Flaming Petals will cast faster if you use a low level of the skill.
*In instances beware guys like [[File:Bloody knight.png|100px]] OGH Bloody Knight, it only receives 1/4 of fire damage and even switch its element to fire, some creatures has a lot of reduction.

=== Instances ===

So, let's see how our magic build can do in some instances. For all instances, a mins with magic strings and a sorcerer casting the Fire Insignia helps.

*'''Old Glast Heim(Normal/Hard):'''
Flaming Petals can pretty much do 200% damage in almost all stuff here, except for Bloody Knight and the bosses doesn't reduce our damage with resistances, a Bathory and Ancient Tree cards can really help here.

Party support is really needed.

*'''Charleston:'''
They don't have resistances too, {{Card |id=4477 Hell Apocalypse Card}} can help in DPS for the last boss, pretty much a easy instance, just be sure to heal yourself from magic damage.

*'''Jitterbug:'''
This would take more time than needed, as we don't really have a really good AOE, it's still good if you have a lot of damage in our crappy AOEs or if you can damage really fast.

*'''Airship:'''
Not a lot to say here, it's a really easy instance.

== Leveling ==
We don't need to rebirth, so our leveling is pretty easy!

'''Creatures weak to fire attacks:''' Payon Dungeon(For newcomers less than Lv30), Orcs(in [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/map/gef_fild03 gef_fild10], Lv 30~40+), [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1127/hode Hodes](Lv ~55+), [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1516/mi-gao Mi Gao](Lv 70+), Moscovia Dungeon(For Lv80+), [https://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1784/stapo Stapo](Lv ~90+), Scaraba(Lv ~125+)
