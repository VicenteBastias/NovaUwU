== Overview ==
If you're reading this, you're tired of popping Steel Body, right clicking, and going to make a sandwich: tanking.  You want to do more with those other 50 skills you have.  You want to go solo and be a combo Sura, and this is the guide for you to do it.  It will focus on helping you be the best combo Sura you can be.

Combo Sura focuses primarily on Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell.  Tiger Cannon does damage proportional to your Max HP, and Gates of Hell does damage proportional to the amount of HP you are missing, meaning high HP is your friend.  You have the ability to buff, damage, tank and even heal, making you an excellent instance partner for anyone if you don't feel like going solo.

I'm still new to this server and still making my fortune to test every single piece of gear out, but like you I want to play Sura the way it was intended.  Punching things in the face, not getting punched in the face.  I'll do my best to add to this as I learn new things.  You can also use the Discussion tab above to add input.

|| Each point of STR adds:
* +1 [http://irowiki.org/wiki/ATK#Status_ATK Status ATK]
* +30 Weight Limit
||One of your secondary stats.  Increases your damage overall and lets you carry more.  Balance this with your AGI depending on your play style and who you play with.
|-
||'''AGI'''

Increases your [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Attack_Speed ASPD]
||The other secondary stat.  You won't be auto attacking much, but the higher your ASPD the faster you can combo.  Also the higher the Flee the more often you will dodge, allowing you to worry less about having your HP high for surviving and leaving you more room to use your HP for your attacks.
|-

Every 5 points adds:

||This is your primary stat.  Increases your HP, which in turn increases both your survivability and your damage with Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell.

Decreases [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#CastTime Variable Cast Time]
||This is your tertiary stat.  You need SP to cast your skills and spells, and it will marginally increase your Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell damage as well, but not enough to be worth dumping a lot of points here.  On top of that, you can restore your own SP(detailed later).
|-
||'''DEX'''
| style="text-align:center;" |90
||Each point of DEX adds:
* +1 Hit&lt;br>
Every 5 points of DEX add:

Decreases [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#CastTime Variable Cast Time]&lt;br>
Increases your [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Attack_Speed ASPD]
||You need enough DEX to hit stuff and that's it.  Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell can be used outside of a combo by casting them, and DEX increases your cast speed.  However, you should be using them via Dragon Combo or Flash Combo.
|-
||'''LUK'''
| style="text-align:center;" |1~2
||Each point of LUK adds:
* +0.3% Crit Rate&lt;br>
Every 3 points of LUK add:

||Combo skills can't be critical hits.  Sure some Perfect Dodge is nice, but you have more important stuff to spend points on that actually increase your damage.

=== Stat Build ===
Start out by getting 80 STR, 80 AGI, 120 VIT, 35 INT, 90 DEX, 1 LUK. Then you can increase STR and AGI based on how you feel about your build.  AGI increases ASPD, which in turn increases animation speed allowing you to combo faster.

Some people may find the timing for comboing gets hard past a certain point of ASPD, so play with your AGI to find the speed most comfortable for you when comboing.  If you find yourself getting hit too much by MVPs you can also add more points into AGI.  This is also very reliant on how you want to gear yourself and what classes you play with, so use your own judgement to move around points as you need.  If you play with an Arch Bishop, you may find you don't need as much AGI for the Flee and can put more into STR.  On the other hand if you play with a Sorcerer who's willing to restore your SP, perhaps you want to max out AGI so you can combo as fast as you can.  Additionally certain gear may add to your AGI or ASPD, causing you to need less to stay in your 'sweet spot'.

=== First Job Skills ===

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 15% " |Skill
! style=" width: 25% " |Effect
! style=" width: 60% " |Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=22 |skill=Divine Protection Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Passive
* +3 DEF against Demon and Undead per level
|This is a prequisite to all Monk skills.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=23 |skill=Demon Bane Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Passive
* +3 ATK against Demon and Undead per level
|Like the above, also a prerequisite for Monk skills.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=29 |skill=Increase Agility Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Castable Buff
* +12 AGI
| +12 AGI for yourself (and that Ranger friend you keep instancing with).
|-
| {{Skill List |id=34 |skill=Blessing Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
| Castable Buff
* +10 STR/INT/DEX
| +10 STR/INT/DEX makes you your own buff machine.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=25 |skill=Pneuma Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| Ground Targeted
* Places a 3x3 barrier ont he ground that nullifies ranged attacks
* Anyone standing in it cannot be hit by ranged attacks, including enemies
|Not necessary but nice if you're getting pelted by ranged attacks and you don't have an AB with you.  Also lets you protect that aforementioned Ranger friend avoid Hell's Judgement (an MVP spell that counts as a ranged attack when standing at a distance of 5 or more cells away) while you're duoing.
|}

=== Second/Trans Job Skills ===

{| class="wikitable" width="95%"
! style=" width: 15% " |Skill
! style=" width: 25% " |Effect
! style=" width: 60% " |Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=265 |skill=Dodge Lv 5-10 |simple=yes}}
| Passive
*Increases Flee up to a max of +15
|Not as powerful as the Thief version, but there's still no reason not to get this and eat less hits.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=264 |skill=Body Relocation LV 1 |simple=yes}}
| Active Skill
*Instantly teleports you to the selected cell
|Because if you're not snapping, you're not a Monk.  Consumes a spirit sphere to cast unless you're in Critical Explosion.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=268 |skill=Steel Body Lv 3-5 |simple=yes}}
| Self Buff
*Reduces all incoming damage to 10%
*Reduces movement and attack speed
*Cannot use skills while active
|As much as we all hate it, sometimes you just have to turn this on and get punched in the face.  Casting will consume 5 Spirit Spheres.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=401 |skill=Dangerous Soul Collect Lv 1 |simple=yes}}
| Self Buff
*Summons all Spirit Spheres
|Transcendent skill only.  This summons 5 Spirit Spheres at once, or all 15 Spheres while under the effect of Rising Dragon.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=259 |skill=Iron Hand Lv 5-10 |simple=yes}}
| Passive
* +3 ATK per level with Knuckle class weapons.
|Only necessary to max if you want to use fist weapons (more on that under equipment), otherwise you only need 5 points as prerequisite.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=271 |skill=Asura Strike Lv 3-5 |simple=yes}}
| Damage Skill
*Does high damage based primarily on SP
*Consumes all SP on cast
*Cannot regen SP for 10 seconds after use
|You only need 3 points as a prerequisite, however you can move points here if you want.  You will have enough SP for this to do decent damage at the end of a combo, about as much as a Tiger Cannon.  However there are builds dedicated to maxing the damage of Asura Strike if you wish to go that route.  Requires you to be in Critical Explosion status and consumes 5 Spirit Spheres unless used at the end of a combo.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=263 |skill=Triple Attack Lv 5-10 |simple=yes}}
| Passive/Combo Skill
*Procs from Autoattacks
|The first Monk combo skill.  As you put points in this the damage increases but the chance to proc goes down, which is a good thing because Triple Attack can't proc other effects like Gentle Touch Energy Gain so you don't want it to proc frequently.  You only need 5 points but I recommend the full 10 to reduce the proc chance while still increasing your overall damage.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=272 |skill=Chain Combo Lv 3 |simple=yes}}
| Combo Skill
*Usable after Triple Attack
|Your second Monk combo skill.  Used right after Triple Attack procs.  You only need 3 points here as a Sura since you'll never use this, but when leveling as a Monk you can put the full 5 in.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=273 |skill=Combo Finish Lv 3 |simple=yes}}
| Combo Skill
*Usable after Chain Combo
|The third Monk combo skill, this one follows Chain Combo.  Again you only need 3 points for Sura, but leveling as Monk feel free to put 5.  Consumes 1 Spirit Sphere when cast.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=270 |skill=Critical Explosion Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
| Self Buff
*3 Minute Duration
*Increases Crit Rate
*Natural SP restoration is disabled
|This is an important buff for Monks and you are required to be in Critical Explosion for various skills.  Casting this will consume 5 Spirit Spheres.  Rising Dragon will put you into Critical Explosion state without needing to cast this separately.

! colspan="2" |Notes
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2326 |skill=Dragon Combo Lv 3~5 |simple=yes}}
| Combo Skill
*Chance to stun
*Opening for Sura combos
| colspan="2 "|The first of your new combo skills.  This is a targetable instant cast that does not require Triple Attack (but can still be used as a combo after it).  This allows you to start a combo instantly on any target.
|- 
| {{Skill List |id=2329 |skill=Fallen Empire Lv 1~10 |simple=yes}}
| Combo Skill
*Usable immediately after Dragon Combo
| colspan="2 "|The second new combo skill.  Use this after Dragon Combo.  The timing will depend on your ASPD.
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2330 |skill=Tiger Cannon Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
|Damage Skill (AOE) / Combo Skill
*Castable AOE
*Instant cast when used after Fallen Empire
*Does damage in an area around you
*Damage dependent on HP and SP
*Consumes HP
|One of your main attacks, consumes a large chunk of your HP to do massive damage.  Use this right after Fallen Empire.  Damage is based on HP, ATK, and to a lesser extent SP.  Part of this damage ignores the HIT check, allowing you to hit even MVPs under AGI UP.  Requires you to be in Critical Explosion and consumes 2 Spirit Spheres on use.
|[[File:TigerCannonCombo250.gif]]
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2343 |skill=Gates of Hell Lv 10 |simple=yes}}
|Damage Skill / Combo Skill
*Castable
*Instant cast when used after Fallen Empire
*Damage based on HP missing
*Consumes SP
|Your other main attack, this one deals more damage the more HP you have missing.  Like Tiger Cannon, this is used after Fallen Empire, and part of this damage ignores HIT check.  Consumes 5 Spirit Spheres on use.  Level 1-4 is resolved as a melee attack and blocked by Safety Wall, while level 5-10 is resolved as a ranged attack and blocked by Pneuma.
|[[File:GatesofHellCombo250.gif]]
|-
| {{Skill List |id=5009 |skill=Flash Combo Lv 5 |simple=yes}}
|Damage Skill
*Uses Dragon Combo, Fallen Empire, Tiger Cannon and Sky Net Blow automatically
*Cannot move during skill duration
*Does not consume HP
*Does not get combo bonuses
|Lets you automatically use your Tiger Cannon combo without consuming HP, but at the cost of less damage.  If Fallen Empire kills the target Tiger Cannon will not go off, so don't bother using on low hp targets (unless you're feeling lazy).  This will consume 5 Spirit Spheres at level 1 and 2, 4 Spirit Spheres at level 3 and 4, and 3 Spirit Spheres at level 5.
|[[File:FlashCombo250.gif]]
|-
| {{Skill List |id=2327 |skill=Sky Net Blow Lv 1-5 |simple=yes}}
|Damage Skill (AOE)
*Damage based on AGI
*Knocks back enemies
| colspan="2 "|Hits all enemies in an area around you, knocking them back.  Damage increases with AGI.  Does not require Spirit Spheres to cast, and is easy to spam, making it a good leveling skill.  However, ultimately the damage falls very short of Tiger Cannon.
|-

=== Builds ===

'''Notice''': In all these build examples Pneuma is taken.  This is optional (but recommended if you don't have an Arch Bishop with you).  In this case you do not have enough points to get all your first job skills, leaving you with 8/10 points in Blessing.  2 spare points from second job are used to finish getting Blessing to 10/10.  If you opt to not take Pneuma, you will have sufficient points to get Blessing without second job points.

[http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/sur.html?10akakHxdAhKhOHqfQksr1bkcjSGAanGAlfabeAIn1 Tiger Cannon Only w/ Gentle Touch - Energy Gain]

This build foregoes Gates of Hell in favour of steadier damage at full HP.  Optimal for people who don't like letting their HP get low or have a high ping time.  Your goal is to combo Tiger Cannon (Dragon Combo -> Fallen Empire -> Tiger Cannon) then use Flash Combo while it cools down.  With some HP leeching gear you should be able to keep your HP up, and if it starts getting too low then continue to use Flash Combo instead of Tiger Cannon to do damage without the HP consumption.  If you want to use minimal consumables, you can opt for spamming Flash Combo.  This will result in less damage but will not drain your HP and will consume less SP.

You have 4 points left over that you can place into Cursed Circle for crowd control, Dragon Combo for more combo damage, or Sky Net Blow for more Flash Combo damage.  You can also move 5 points out of Iron Hand if not using fist weapons, probably into Heal; and 2 points from Steel Body into Asura Strike if you prefer to have that option open.
&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>

[http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/sur.html?10akakHxdAhKhOHqfQksr1bdpjQGAanGAkQrodnIn1 Tiger Cannon Only w/ Gentle Touch - Revitalize]

This changes your self buff from Energy Gain to Revitalize.  You no longer gain Spirit Spheres while attacking, but your Max HP is much higher and you gain some bonus Soft DEF.  With the left over points you have a few options.  You can opt to spend them to get Flash Combo, if you do this you can only get Lv 4 of Revitalize.  You can also max out Revitalize and then put those points into Cursed Circle for crowd control, or Fallen Empire/Dragon Combo for more damage.  This is an excellent build when partnering with Rune Knights and Royal Guards.
&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>
[[File:GoHBuild.jpg]]

[http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/sur.html?10akakHxdAhKhOHqfQksr1bjPjQJ1nGAkfabdnIn1 Gates of Hell + Tiger Cannon]

This build alternates between Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell, slowly eating away at your HP.  This is for people comfortable maintaining low levels of health and have plenty of consumables.  Alternate between comboing into Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell.  Your SP in particular will drop super fast, so have SP pots ready.  An Incubus pet can be of a lot of help here.

The left over skill points can be added to Fallen Empire and Dragon Combo to increase combo damage, to Flash Combo for a second Tiger Cannon while the primary skill is on cooldown, or to Cursed Circle for more crowd control.

== Equipment ==

Gear will be labeled into 'Offensive' (pure attack gear), 'Defensive' (pure defensive gear), 'Balanced' (something inbetween), and 'Leeching' (for HP/SP leeching).  You should build yourself according to your play style.  If you want to spend less on potions, use more leeching gear.  If you are playing with a friend who provides a lot of damage you can build more defensive.  If you find you are able to stay at full HP and want to kill faster, swap in more offensive pieces.  PVP gear may be added in the future, but right now I'm focused on getting all my PVE gear tested out.

=== Level 125 Gear ===

This is a fairly cheap, easy to get set of gear ideal for people starting out.  Some of it can be obtained before 125, and you should try to have all of it by 130 to make your leveling life much easier.

The element of the weapon should correspond to whatever you are killing.  In general Holy weapons are highly demanded for most end game instances which are often against Demons and Undead.  Neutral element is a good starting element as it's useful against everything but Ghosts.  Shadow is generally lack-luster with most end game enemies being strong to it.

Tired of being shoehorned into using maces?  I got you covered.  The bonus damage from Crimson weapons ignores size modifiers (this is why DD GX is so good with Crimson Daggers).

Ask yourself "Are these enchants worth giving up a card slot for?".

Best enchants to look for are +7 or more STR/VIT and +Damage or DEF Bypass to common enemy types (Undead and Demons are often found in end game instances).  Also watch for ones with elements, especially Holy.

If you're just starting out don't be afraid to get a cheap one with INT or DEX on it too, the most important part is the +15% HP from the combo bonus with Temporal Boots, you can work on getting a better one later.

||Provides multiple bonuses based on your stats and the refine level, for Sura the main ones would be:
* At 90 STR, gives +20 ATK at 7 refine and +30 ATK at 9 refine.
* At 90 VIT, gives +5% Neutral resistance at 7 refine and +10% at 9 refine.
* At 90 AGI, gives +1 ASPD at 9 refine (the 7 refine bonus is worthless to you as %ASPD requires stacking, and you aren't stacking it).

The primary reason for choosing this over GSS is the nice neutral resistance bonus, but has to be at least +7.

Total bonus for Temporal Boots + GSS combo depends on your GSS, but generally looking at around +16 stats, +23% HP, +5% SP before refining and enchanting.  You want STR enchant for the boots, which will become Fighting Spirit 6/7 as you upgrade it (the base boot bonuses are worth 6.25 ATK vs 1% HP, where as the enchant is worth 12 ATK vs 1% HP, making the ATK enchant good enough to be better than %HP).  The optimal special enchant will be Bear's Might.

||Only an option if you go 120 BASE STR.  These ''might'' give very slightly more overall damage than the VIT boots, primarily through Fallen Empire which doesn't get any bonus from HP.  You do however lose a lot of HP choosing these over VIT boots and %HP scales better with more VIT/HP gear than flat ATK bonuses.

== Pure Tanking ==
So you got forced into tanking.  That's okay, I'm here to help.  I won't give a full detailed guide but I'll help you get started.

Your role is to tank all the damage while putting as little strain on your healer as possible.  This means a lot of health, a lot of defense and a lot of resistance.  Don't worry about hitting hard, chances are you have a DPS class with your party for that.  Your primary skill is Steel Body, and since you'll be in Steel Body most of the time you won't be able to use any other skills much.  You'll want to have an attack of some sort handy in case you do need to help with damage, but for the most part you'll be focused on putting skill points in buffs.  Stat-wise, you'll be putting less into your damage stats and more into making yourself as immune to status effects as possible and bulking yourself up.

'''[http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/sur.html?10akakJkandslbHqfQlfr1bdpjQGAbnGAkQrAdnIn1 Here is an example build].'''

You want full points in Gentle Touch - Revitalize and you want to keep that up on yourself between Steel Body casts.  It will give you a lot of extra MaxHP and DEF.  Additionally try to keep Gentle Touch - Change on whoever is doing damage.  Rising Dragon allows you to follow up with Steel Body and increases your HP even more.  Cursed Circle lets you round up a lot of mobs and force them to just stand there while your team kills them, but remember you can't use it while Steel Body is active.

== Leveling ==
'''Disclaimer: This leveling guide is written based on features available in NovaRO.  This guide may not be optimal for other servers.'''
=== Lv 1 - Lv 99 ===
&lt;center>===='''Lv 1 - Lv 30'''====&lt;/center>
* Fresh off the boat after making your character, head West, then North to the top of Izlude to enter the Criatura Academy.  You can type &lt;code>/navi izlude 122/207&lt;/code> into the chat bar and navigation arrows will show you the way.  Talk to the receptionist and register for the Academy to instantly be given job level 10 and a handful of potions to start with.  Feel free to explore the Academy as a new player to learn various things about RO.
* You can then use &lt;code>@go Prontera&lt;/code> to warp directly to Prontera, a pop up will tell you to enter the Main Office to your left where you will find the job changer npc.  This will let you change to Acolyte, your first job.
* If you need a couple early levels run outside Prontera and hit porings.
* Pump your INT and put all your skill points into Heal.  Turn &lt;code>/noshift&lt;/code> on, warp to Payon Dungeon and heal bomb zombies and skeletons.  You will level so fast that your SP will refill as you use it.  Put both level 10 and level 5 of Heal on your bar, use level 5 when you start one-shotting things to save SP.
* '''Level 26''': [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_26-39 Instructor Boya's Eden Equipment Quest] in Payon Cave:
** This quest must be taken before level 34.
** Use &lt;code>@go eden&lt;/code> to warp to Eden.
** Talk to Secretary Lime Evenor and sign up for Eden.  This also gives you Eden Group Mark which teleports you to your save point when used.
** Talk to Instructor Boya to begin the quest.
** Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Payon Cave before you start hunting Skeletons and Poporings. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member, then to Instructor Boya.
** You will receive your first set of Eden Equipment from Administrator Michael in the room behind the Blue Door.  Choose the wand as your weapon choice.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''Lv 30 - 59'''====&lt;/center>
* Continue to pump INT and head to Orc Dungeon where you can now heal bomb Orc Zombies and Skeletons.  Learn Teleport to get away from annoying bats and Blessing for more damage or AGI Up to get around faster.
* At Job Level 50 you can change into Monk.
* '''Level 50''': [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_40-59 Instructor Boya's Eden Equipment Quest] in Orc Dungeon: 
** This quest must be taken before level 60.
** Use &lt;code>@go eden&lt;/code> to warp to Eden.
** Talk to Instructor Boya to begin the quest.
** Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Orc Dungeon before you start hunting Orc Zombies and Orc Skeletons. 
** When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Boya. 
** You will receive your second set of Eden Equipment from Administrator Michael in the room behind the Blue Door.  Once again choose the wand for your weapon.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''Lv 60 - 85'''====&lt;/center>
* You can start adding AGI or VIT here for a little survivability once your INT is maxed.
* Head to Glast Heim St. Abbey and heal bomb Wraiths and Evil Druids.  It shouldn't take very long to hit 71 at which point...
* '''IMPORTANT: Pick up the kill Wraiths and Evil Druids quest from the level 71-85 board, but do NOT turn it in.'''
* '''Level 70''': [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_70-79 Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest] in Glast Heim: 
** This quest must be taken before level 80.
** Use &lt;code>@go eden&lt;/code> to warp to Eden.
** Talk to Instructor Ur to begin the quest.
** Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Glast Heim Churchyard before you start hunting Wraiths and Evil Druids. 
** When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Ur. 
** You will receive your third and final set of Eden Equipment from Blacksmith Thorn in the room behind the Blue Door.  This time you can choose the mace (the Eden mace has a higher base ATK and maces do better damage against medium and large enemies and is recommended).
&lt;br>&lt;br>

&lt;center>===='''Lv 85 - Lv 99'''====&lt;/center>
* '''IMPORTANT: Check if any mobs in gramps map are available from [[Eden Group#Level 85 - 90|Level 85-90]] and [[Eden Group#Level 91 - 99|Level 91-99]] quest boards, and do not turn these in yet.  (Example, current rotation has Dark Priest and Roween on it, both of which available on quest boards)'''
* Level range to join the first bracket of Gramps quests. Gramps groups are large hunting quests for 400 enemies on special maps.  These quests are taken on in large groups with everyone working together.  More information can be found [[Gramps|on the Gramps page]].  Note that Gramps quests are rotated at the start of every month. You can also hunt them outside of Gramps map. Use the &lt;code>@whereis (monster name)&lt;/code> command to find out where a monster spawns.
* At this point you can use the reset NPC in Protera [[Main Office]] and swap to a [http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/sur.html?10akakHxdAhKhOHqfQksr1bkcjSGAanGAlfabeAIn1 basic monk damage build] using your eden group mace/knuckle.  Get Snap and be a lurer or Steel Body and be the groups tank.  If both roles are already filled, simply do your best to keep stray mobs off your healer and support, don't try to be the main DPS, that's not your job yet.
* Put your DEX up to 60 so you can hit stuff, then evenly distribute between STR AGI and VIT for a general stat build that will let you fulfill any role in a gramps group.
* '''DO NOT TURN IN GRAMPS QUESTS''', finish them (and help your group finish), then go and rebirth.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''Optional Lv 91 - Lv 99'''====&lt;/center>
* If you do not wish to do Gramps, choose [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group quests on the boards] in Eden and do them.  As a monk, you gain damage bonuses against Undead making the monsters in Glast Heim a good choice.  But I recommend doing Gramps.
* If choosing to quest, I recommend going with higher AGI to allow you to dodge more and require less consumables. You still need 60 DEX, and possibly around 20 VIT and 40 STR, then the rest in AGI.
&lt;br>&lt;br>

=== Rebirth ===
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''Rebirthed'''====&lt;/center>
* Go out and punch a couple Porings until job level 10, then head back to the main office and change into High Acolyte.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''High Acolyte'''====&lt;/center>
* Do the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] quest to easily hit job level 50.  You will need only 6 Holy Water and 6 Blue Gems in your inventory, which can be bought from the Tool Dealer.  It then involves running around talking to NPCs in &lt;code>@go Malaya&lt;/code>.  No fighting or even map changes.  This quest is also a prerequisite to access several instances in Port Malaya.
* Or go back to Payon and continue heal bombing your way up again, this is the hard way if you choose to go this route.  If doing this you should place your stats into INT.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''Champion'''====&lt;/center>
* Turn in Gramps quests to instantly hit 99/69.  Pick up a Glast Heim kill quest from the boards and go do it quickly.  If you want to reset your stats after hitting Sura, put your DEX up to 60 and then put the rest evenly into STR and AGI to make quick work of kills.  If you don't want to reset your stats, DEX can be 50~60 and the rest can be put at a ratio of 1 STR : 1 AGI : 3 VIT.
* Alternatively if you were able to do any of the 91-99 board quests during your gramps, one of them can be turned in now for that last job level.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;center>===='''Sura'''====&lt;/center>
* Congrats you're now a Sura, turn in the last of any quest board quests (Evil Druid/Wraith/Any bonus ones from gramps) you had stored up for some instant skill points.

| Level 50
| [[Endless Tower]]
[[Endless Cellar]]
|These can be accessed as early as level 50, but not recommended until level 100.  It's recommended to come in a party, as it involves defeating increasingly difficult MVPS.
|-
| Level 100
| [[Sara's Memory]]
| An excellent instance to farm +6 food in.
|-
| Level 100
| [[Infinite Space]]
| Similar to Endless Tower/Cellar, this instance has 50 floors full of enemies you need to kill, with an MVP every 10 floors.  However all enemies in here have had their HP pools massively increased.  This is where you can get yourself an Ancient Decoration of Rift.

&lt;br>
* For Gramps, focus on getting Flash Combo 1, then Tiger Cannon to 10, then Rising Dragon to 10.  This will allow you to spam Flash Combo in Gramps groups and do some decent damage.  If your group needs a lurer (via Snap) or tank (via Steel Body) be prepared to fill those roles, otherwise continue to keep stray mobs off your healer/support, you aren't the main damage yet.
* If you choose to solo level instead of Gramps, get Sky Net Blow.  This is low damage but easily spammed, allowing you to go to high spawn areas like Magma Dungeon and aoe things.  Remember to pick up the quest board quests for it!
* Go ahead and just put your DEX up to 90 right away so you never have to worry about Hit.  Get around 40~50 STR and AGI, then put the rest into VIT.
* Once you have Flash Combo or Sky Net Blow, you can farm Magma Dungeon 2 for money really easily.
* Additionally as you level more instances will become available, each with its own rewards and level requirements.  You can find a full list of them [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Instances here].

|-
| '''Required Level'''
| '''Instance Name'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| Level 120
| [[Ghost Palace]]
| This is where you get Thanatos Weapons.  Must be done solo.
|-
| Level 120
| [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]]
| Recommend doing this with a party until you get higher leveled.
|-
| Level 125
| [[Airship Assault]]
| Airship gear comes from mobs here, don't even need to kill the boss at the end.
|-
| Level 130
| [[Old Glast Heim]]
| Normal Mode recommended before level 160.  You need a party until you have better gear, but recommended to start farming this if you find a group.
|-
| Level 140
| [[Horror Toy Factory]]
| Nothing interesting for Suras here, but worth doing for zeny if you join a group doing it.  Also gives a lot of exp for leveling.
|-
| Level 140
| [[Central Laboratory]]
| Requires [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Phantasmagorica a string of quests] as prerequisite.  Spawns 3 random MVPs in a row, makes for a short fun run.  Recommended to be well geared and be a higher level when doing this.
|-
| Level 140
| [[Dimensional Travel]]
| Not an instance, but a very important quest that unlocks many end game instances.
|}
&lt;br>
* Level range to join the second bracket of Gramps quests.
* Gramps: Finish off Flash Combo to 5, then pump the rest of your combo skills.  Continue to be lurer or tank as your group needs you to be, but as your HP starts to get higher you'll be able to put out a lot more damage.  And for the love of everything don't spam Sky Net Blow in a group, you'll just annoy everyone.
* Solo: Work on getting Tiger Cannon to 10 now, then 1 point of Flash Combo and 10 Rising Dragon.  Head to Gefenia or Glast Heim Chivalry to level (and pick up the kill quests).
* Get VIT up to 120 if it isn't yet.  Start playing with how you want your STR and AGI set up, don't worry about INT much yet, put it up a little if you need to otherwise ignore it.
* Gefenia is a popular place for farming zeny, killing primarily Succubus and Incubus and selling their drops.  Magma Dungeon 2 is can also be good money if you can't take on Gefenia yet.  Also running Ghost Palace and selling the Thanatos Weapons can make you a daily profit!

|-
| Level 145
| [[Sarah and Fenrir]]
| A very tough instance, don't attempt this without a group.  Rewards you with enchantable accessories.
|-
| Level 145
| [[Sky Fortress]]
| The newest instance, Vicious Mind weapons drop in here.  Requires you to complete [[Banquet for Heroes#Room of Consciousness|Room of Consciousness]] to access.
|-
| Level 160
| [[Wolfchev's Laboratory]]
| Ancient Gold Ornaments can be obtained here, which sell for good zeny.
|-
| Level 160
| [[Bios Island]]
| Requires [[Dimensional Travel]] to be completed.
|-
| Level 160
| [[Morse Cave]]
| Requires [[Bios Island]] to be completed.
|-
| Level 160
| [[Temple of the Demon God]]
| Requires [[Morse Cave]] to be completed.  The three of these instances drop important endgame gear for all classes, and reward you with Token of Hero for your Hero Rings.
|-
| Level 160
| [[Monster Hunter]]
| A uniquely styled instance that offers costume gear with stats as rewards.
|}
&lt;br>
* Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests.
* At this point if you have some decent gear and the proper element (either via Converter or Crimson Weapon) your Tiger Cannon will rival Arrow Storm for damage and you'll have the HP to walk into the middle of the mob train to use it.  Congrats, you're on your way to being a beast.  Don't worry about being the tank anymore, just kill everything.
* Continue with the Flash Combo build just to make Gramps easier as you walk around spamming it, you can swap over to Gates of Hell if you choose to once you start gearing up at 175.
* You can also now level in Scaraba Hole using Tiger Cannon.  Watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wz-SNlYH2U this video] for an example of how to do it.  It involves gathering up large groups of Scaraba in Scaraba Hole and Tiger Cannoning them.
* Put your INT up finally and finalize how you want your STR/AGI.
* If you need money, head to Gefenia and round up groups of mobs and Tiger Cannon them down.  As you get more powerful you'll be able to start soloing OGH Normal and Nightmarish Jitterbug daily for good zeny as well.  Don't forget you have the potential to solo MVPs for money as you get geared, just remember to bring an elemental converter for a damage boost when doing it.  If the MVP has AGI UP, your Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell will cut right through it.

== Tips ==
*You can cast Dragon Combo to instantly start a combo instead of waiting for a Triple Attack proc.  This is much more reliable and easier to hit the rest of the combo since you know it's coming.
*You can restore your own SP!  While in Rising Dragon, cast Power Absorb to absorb all your Sphere, then cast Dangerous Soul Collect to restore them all.  Repeat for a 14% gain in SP each cast.
[[File:SuraSPRestore.gif]]
*Additionally if you're mid fight and can't cast Dangerous Soul Collect, if you have Gentle Touch-Energy Gain active you can punch things for Spheres to Absorb.
*Remember that you can Gentle Touch-Cure yourself out of Frozen and Stone.
*Use Pneuma to protect ranged friends from Hell's Judgement, a screen-wide spell cast by various MVPs that deals ranged damage to anyone standing more than 4 cells from the caster.  Pneuma will negate this damage to them, however it won't protect you in melee range.
*{{Item List |id=11520 |item=Mora Mandarin |simple=yes}} can be bought from the Tool Dealer, keep some on hand for emergency SP restoration.
*Tiger Cannon and Gates of Hell ignore the HIT check with part of their damage.  You won't get full damage for missing but you can still do damage to things with high FLEE.
*You can move points around to get Asura Strike to 5, your gear will allow it to do decent damage still letting you use it as a finisher if needed.
*Use the training dummies in Prontera to play around with your AGI/ASPD and how fast the combo input is.  You don't have to worry about dying or mobs moving while testing.  Find that sweet spot for you where you have 100% input accuracy.  You can warp to them with the Warper NPC &lt;code>Special Areas > Training Dummies&lt;/code>.

== Afterword ==
I have been playing Ragnarok Online since it was in Alpha, and when Monk was released it quickly became my favourite class.  This guide has been a compilation of everything I've learned about being a combo Sura and I hope it helps anyone looking for Sura information.  I can often be found playing NovaRO on my Sura, Palderon, if anyone has questions.  I can also be found on the forums, also as Palderon, and I've also mentioned that the discussion tab at the top of this page can be used to ask question or suggest other gear or builds.
