== Overview ==
Lu7ky (Lucky) here, I am a long time Ragnarok Online player and have quite a bit of experience, now, with NovaRO.  I don't play PVP at all yet so I want to play all classes as PVM only. I do not play Shadow Chaser as a main class but found it one of the most fun as you can be unpredictable and adaptable.
*Shadow Chaser is primarily a PVP orientated class, make sure you save some Zeny if you want to try it out. As this guide is PVM Focused, I will not be going into PVP so some parts you are expecting won't be here.

*Jack of all trades, master of none, the Shadow Chaser, (SC for short) is very versatile for the fact that they can copy most skills of players or monsters. 

*Has a sweet alternate outfit!

=== Shadow Chaser pros ===
*They can adapt their stats for different builds. (Use Build Manager NPC to make this easier).
* Gets large base max HP. Stay in those fights longer and finish off MVPs before someone gets to it while you respawn.
* Low ASPD penalties. Keep up the attack with a barrage of attacks, setting off your Auto Shadow Spell.
* Reliable damage overall. Be effective as a DPS class and have a role in the game.
*Can use a variety of daggers, swords and bows them useful at range or up close.

=== Shadow Chaser cons ===
*Very hard to master. This class is not for the feint of heart, I do not recommend this as a first character for new players.
*They do not excel in PVM as well as most classes. But you and I sure will try to prove them wrong.
*Tricky to switch on the fly as ranged, due to having very different gears for each build.

== Stat Overview ==
*''' Strength (STR)''' Provides ATK for melee weapons and a reduced amount for bows. Increases weight limit and resistance to certain skills.

*''' Agility (AGI)''' Adds FLEE, ASPD and Soft DEF (much less than VIT would). Shortens animation delay. At 100 points gives Immunity to Sleep and Bleeding.

*''' Vitality (VIT)''' Adds Max HP, Soft DEF, HP recovery and makes healing items more effective. At 100 points gives Immunity to Stun, Poison and Deadly Poison.

*''' Intelligence (INT)''' Adds MATK Max SP, Soft MDEF, SP recovery and makes SP restoring items more effective. Decreases Variable Cast Time (Half as much as DEX). At 100 points gives Immunity to Silence.

*''' Dexterity (DEX)''' Adds ATK for bows and a reduced amount for melee weapons. Increases HIT, ASPD, MATK and Soft MDEF. Decreases Variable Cast Time. 

*''' Luck (LUK)''' Adds ATK (less than STR), MATK (less than INT), CRIT, HIT, Perfect Dodge and FLEE.  At 100 points gives Immunity to Curse.

== How to Copy Skills ==

=== Dueling ===
*To get into a fight with players you must duel them and have them accept.
**To start the duel, first type &lt;code>@duel&lt;/code>, (no comma) then type the players name for example: &lt;code>@duel Lu7ky&lt;/code>
**The other player can then type &lt;code>@accept&lt;/code> or &lt;code>@reject&lt;/code> based (so ask first!) Note, this is allowed in towns, take advantage!
*To leave a duel simply have a player die and the other type &lt;code>@leave&lt;/code> or have both players type &lt;code>@leave&lt;/code>.

=== Plagiarism ===
*With {{Skill List |id=225 |skill=Plagiarism |simple=yes}} learned, copy applicable first and second job skills simply by being hit with it. Note, you must survive the hit.
*With {{Skill List |id=475 |skill=Preserve|simple=yes}} buff activated, keep your {{Skill List |id=225 |skill=Plagiarism |simple=yes}} skill copied for the duration of the buff.

=== Reproduce ===
*With {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}} buff active (on) take a hit and survive from the spell you desire to copy.
*Turn off {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}} buff to hold the skill until a new one is learned via this process.

== Arrow Build ==
=== Overview ===
*Good for keeping out of direct combat and great for leveling.
*Easy to learn, the Arrow Build is a great choice for beginners and for lower level characters as at this point you can really compete with other Ranger's and Minstrel's damage.

=== Stats === 
*'''STR''' - 1 Increases damage output. Increases Weight limit, not needed for this build.
*'''AGI''' - ~100 for Dodge, ASPD and {{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot |simple=yes}} Damage (Not so much ASPD as when using {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm |simple=yes}}).
*'''VIT''' - 92(100 with bonuses for resistances) to increase max HP and SoftDEF. 
*'''INT''' - ~100 to reduce variable cast time, increase max SP and MDEF. 
*'''DEX''' - 100~120 Depending on what equipment you use (120 for ({{Item List |id=22008 |item=Temporal Boots of Dexterity |slots=1 |simple=yes}})
*'''LUK''' - 1 Optional. Increases CRIT Rate and CRIT Damage as well as perfect dodge.

Opt for more AGI when using {{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot |simple=yes}} or {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}} often.

===== Notes =====
* A +15 {{Item List |id=18130 |item=Crimson Bow |slots=2 |simple=yes}}  will do more damage than a +15 {{Item List |id=18145 |item= Vigilante Bow |slots=2 |simple=yes}}, for damage purpose it is recommended to have a Crimson at refines of 10+ and when not lacking in SP (full set bonus of reduced {{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot |simple=yes}} SP cost).
*{{Item List |id=19296 |item=Fancy Feather Hat GC |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Compliments with the following to
*{{Item List |id=2554 |item=Nidhoggur's Shadow Garb |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Boost {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm |simple=yes}}damage. (Per 2 garment refine.)
*{{Item List |id=2544 |item=Leather Of Tenrdillion |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Boost {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}}damage. (Per 2 garment refine.)
*{{Item List |id=2525 |item=Ancient Cape |slots=1 |simple=yes}} Boost {{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot |simple=yes}} damage. (Per 2 garment refine.)

=== Gameplay ===
*The moment you can, grab {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm |simple=yes}} or {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}}.
*These will need to be copied from an archer third job class using {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}}. Do not turn on {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}} once the skill has been copied, it will lock in place and unless you want to switch would absorb the next damaging skill you take.
*This build is very viable for Gramps missions and can get you to level 175 quite easily.
*AGI stat at this point is mostly for dodge but is required for {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}} damage to be higher.
*Keep in mind you will not do full damage with either of the above skills
*When in a party {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm |simple=yes}} is more effective vs monsters that will die in one or a few hits from you and your party members firing AOE skills all at once. On the other hand, {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}} is greater for smaller parties or soloing as it makes targets flinch and deals damage over a duration allowing you to follow up easier.
*You may choose to opt for INT, LUK and DEX and go with a trap arrow build utilizing flinching attacks, traps copied from ranger classes or the {{Skill List |id=117 |skill=Ankle Snare |simple=yes}} from {{Skill List |id=5010 |skill=Emergency Escape |simple=yes}} and your auto attacks ({{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}} as included). Allow the monster to slowly follow you by alternating these, most monsters are susceptible to flinch attacks such as those from Fire Wall or Fire Walk.
*Keep in mind with many monsters in the target area that {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}} is great at triggering effects of your equipment such as Hawk Eye, Speed of Light and Lucky Day due to the sheer amount of hits. Try using this with and following up with skills like {{Skill List |id=2304 |skill=Feint Bomb |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=2288 |skill=Triangle Shot |simple=yes}}, or traps (again from rangers or {{Skill List |id=5010 |skill=Emergency Escape |simple=yes}}).

==== Skills to grab for Auto Shadow Spell ====
*Knock back spells Such as {{Skill List |id=84 |skill=Jupitel Thunder |simple=yes}} 
*Freezing Spells such as {{Skill List |id=88 |skill=Frost Nova |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=15 |skill=Frost Diver |simple=yes}}
*AOE spells such as {{Skill List |id=83 |skill=Meteor Storm |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=85 |skill=Lord of Vermillion |simple=yes}}
**A good spell that combines all of these is {{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust |simple=yes}} but may mess up your aim.

===== Spell Enhancing Cards =====
*{{Card |id=4429 Salamander Card}} Boosts {{Skill List |id=80 |skill=Fire Pillar |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=83 |skill=Meteor Storm |simple=yes}} damage.
*{{Card |id=4345 Hill Wind Card}} Boosts {{Skill List |id=21 |skill=Thunder Storm |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=84 |skill=Jupitel Thunder |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=85 |skill=Lord of Vermillion |simple=yes}}  damage.
*{{Card |id=4350 Laurell Weinder Card}} Boosts {{Skill List |id=88 |skill=Frost Nova |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust |simple=yes}} damage.
*{{Card |id=4335 Pitman Card}} Boosts {{Skill List |id=90 |skill=Earth Spike |simple=yes}}  and {{Skill List |id=91 |skill=Heavens Drive |simple=yes}} damage.
*{{Card |id=4380 Red Ferus Card}} Boosts {{Skill List |id=80 |skill=Fire Pillar |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=83 |skill=Meteor Storm |simple=yes}} damage.
*{{Card |id=27026 Fire Condor Card}} Boosts {{Skill List |id=17 |skill=Fire Ball |simple=yes}} Damage and reduces it's manual, variable cast time.

*For auto cast cards I recommend {{Card |id=4320 Bloody Knight Card}},{{Card |id=4431 Kasa Card}}, {{Card |id=4632 Owl Marquees Card}} and {{Card |id=4631 Owl Viscount Card}}

===== Example end game shields =====
*{{Item List |id=28942 |item=Cursed Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=28946 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}}
**Enchants Should Include ASPD and Remove Weapon size penalty on {{Item List |id=28946 |item=Purified Knight's Shield |slots=1 |simple=yes}} exclusively.

=== Gameplay ===
*{{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=Auto Shadow Spell |simple=yes}} Will allow you automatically use a spell that is first copied using {{Skill List |id=225 |skill=Plagiarism |simple=yes}}.
*Make sure to keep up {{Skill List |id=475 |skill=Preserve|simple=yes}} at all times, a single magic spell may come and hit you the second it wears off, cast it again before the buff is completely gone.
*Once a major AOE spell has been cast make sure to hide or move as the monsters will most likely aggro to you.
*Remember your spells from {{Skill List |id=225 |skill=Plagiarism |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}} won't do the same damage as the spell cast from the original source, keep attacking when not in trouble.
*All status effects from spells will activate at the same chances, use this wisely to freeze, burn, etcetera your enemies.

==== Suggestions for Auto Shadow Spell ====
*{{Skill List |id=83 |skill=Meteor Storm |simple=yes}} combined with the MATK and ATK enhancing {{Skill List |id=2054 |skill=Duple Light |simple=yes}} is definitely the preferred combination of spells to copy due to amount of hits per cast, raw power and element (Fire) that is good against most enemies for leveling and some endgame content.
*{{Skill List |id=86 |skill=WaterBall |simple=yes}} is a great skill to lock down enemies with it's massive amounts of hits (hit-locking). Try this out in maps like Abyss Dungeons. You can copy level 10 {{Skill List |id=86 |skill=WaterBall |simple=yes}} from Drake.
*{{Skill List |id=88 |skill=Frost Nova |simple=yes}} can work great in parties as it will freeze enemies without moving them around like {{Skill List |id=89 |skill=Storm Gust|simple=yes}} would.
*Move opponents around (into corners for example) with {{Skill List |id=2479 |skill=Thorn Trap |simple=yes}} and Knockback magic like {{Skill List |id=84 |skill=Jupitel Thunder |simple=yes}} from cards like {{Card |id=4264 Wind Ghost Card}}, they are left stuck even after the knock back.
**Try moving opponents into other skills that are stationary but last time such as {{Skill List |id=2482 |skill=Thorn Wall |simple=yes}} using the above method.
*While some item cast spells have been made to, {{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=Auto Shadow Spell |simple=yes}} does not work with bows.
*Your {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}} spells cannot be auto cast, these are always manual as are any copied holy or hybrid (physical/magic) and physical spells.

== Tank/PVM Build ==
=== Overview ===
*For those who do not wish to die repeatedly or like a more supportive role.
*Can live against some higher level opponents but deals less damage than the other builds.
*Can be adapted more to deal some damage in the later game.

*'''STR''' - 1 or 50+, Increases damage output. Increases Weight limit.
*'''AGI''' - ~100 for Dodge, ASPD.

*'''DEX''' - 1 or ~100 Depending on what skills you use.
*'''LUK''' - 1 Optional. This may be useful for a Perfect Dodge build Tank.

With shields many options is always a good idea.

==== Notes ====
*{{Item List |id=1208 |item=Main Gauche |slots=4 |simple=yes}} Will not be effective for damage, so, carded with {{Item List |id=4919 |item=Essence of evil VIT3|simple=yes}} is really the only way to go when using this weapon. Other one-handed 4 slot weapons can work the same way.
*Alternatively use 2 {{Item List2 |id=39537 |item=Modification Orb (Fast)|simple=yes}} in place of Defensive options on {{Item List2 |id=20933 |item=Illusion Engine Wing A-Type |simple=yes}}.

=== Gameplay ===
{{Skill List |id=152 |skill=Throw Stone |simple=yes}} cannot miss. If using this skill exclusively for tanking purposes, put more points into AGI, then INT instead of DEX.
*{{Item List |id=13090|item=Faceworm Queen's Leg|slots=2 |simple=yes}}, {{Skill List |id=214 |skill=Raid |simple=yes}} and AOE {{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=Auto Shadow Spell |simple=yes}} are great ways to attract attention from the other party members and onto you, then hide temporarily to avoid dying.
*{{Skill List |id=51 |skill=Hiding |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=150 |skill=Back Slide |simple=yes}} are your most important skills in this build. Hide when losing more HP than you are gaining and Backslide to pull monsters from corners and towards your group for killing.
*Try using {{Skill List |id=5010 |skill=Emergency Escape |simple=yes}} to place a trap and hold stronger or harder to hit monsters in place for your party to finish off.

== Leveling ==

=== Lv. 1 - Lv. 99 ===
==== Novice ====
* '''Lv. 1 - Lv. 16+'''
** Fresh off the boat you are! Make sure to talk to Captain Carroc to find out how to play if you do not already know how and again after getting off the boat.
** Talk to the Agi Acolyte after that to get a speed boost.
** You should have some guiding red arrows showing you towards Criatura Staff Member Hun. Talk to Hun and he will give you some more "how to play tips". Drink  the Apple Juice he gives you then talk to him again for a few levels.
** Hun can guide you towards the Academy now with more arrows. Go register for the Academy for enough job levels to change to Thief.
*** Optional: Take the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Novice_Skill_Quest Novice quests] and [http://ragnarok.wikia.com/wiki/Quest:Basic_Medical_Botany Red Herb Quest] Inside the academy, this won't take long.
** Next, talk to the shop helper just northwest of the fountain (city center). Listen to her, then take the experience quest. Tell her you will do it and go buy a red potion from the store. 
** After this she will ask you to sell a poor can. This whole process will teach you about NPC selling and buying and will net you a big amount of experience.
** Make sure to spend your skill points! Head over to Prontera using the custom server command @go prontera or @go 0. Here you will be greeted and guided to the Main Office building. Follow the red arrows on the ground inside and head to the upper left to the Job Master. Speak with him to become a Thief Class. Make sure to use your Novice Package provided to you by NovaRO.
&lt;!--


-->
==== Thief ====
* '''Lv. 16 - Lv. 26'''
** Head back outside to the city or to your favorite city as they will all have a custom Warper NPC. Once there, use the Warper to go to Payon Dungeon and fight Zombies only to start! This is very important, anything else will kill you before you can kill it!
** Use {{Skill List |id=149 |skill=Sprinkle Sand |simple=yes}} until you have {{Skill List |id=48 |skill=Double Attack |simple=yes}} (should be learned first). Next level up your {{Skill List |id=49 |skill=Improve Dodge |simple=yes}}.
** Remember {{Skill List |id=53 |skill=Detoxify |simple=yes}} will cure your zombie poison and {{Skill List |id=150 |skill=Back Slide |simple=yes}} will get your around faster and out of large mobs of enemies.
** Also have autoloot turned on to buy yourself some equipment at a later level.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv. 26 - Lv. 50'''
**Continue leveling in the Payon Dungeons while doing the Eden Quest below. Go on to Floor 2 when trying to reach base level 50.
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_26-39 Instructor Boya's Eden Equipment Quest] in Payon Cave: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Payon Cave before you start hunting Skeletons and Poporings. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member, then to Instructor Boya. You will receive your first set of Eden Equipment from Administrator Michael in the room behind the Blue Door.
==== Rogue/Stalker ====
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv. 50 - Lv. 59'''
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_40-59 Instructor Boya's Eden Equipment Quest] in Orc Dungeon: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Orc Dungeon before you start hunting Orc Zombies and Orc Skeletons. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Boya. You will receive your second set of Eden Equipment from Administrator Michael in the room behind the Blue Door.
** There are many many monsters in this area and it may be tough to level up at first. {{Skill List |id=49 |skill=Improve Dodge |simple=yes}} should be maxed by now and will give you an edge in the one on one fights at least.
*** An alternative area is Beach Dungeon 3 where you will fight Thara Frogs and Megalodons. Avoid Neraids as they are currently much too strong for you.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv. 59 -Lv. 71'''
** By now you should have hit job level 50 and have turned into a Rogue.
** Simply grind with the dagger you just got from Eden Equipment Quest #2 until level 71 in the Orc Dungeons. Alternatively get a Kindle Dagger in Einbroch (/navi ein_in01 119/26) for a measly 10,000 zeny.
** If you choose to go down the Arrow Build Path however you can buy a Cheap bow for now such as a {{Item List |id=1714 |item= Gakkung Bow |slots=1 |simple=yes}} from the Payon Weapon Dealer or {{Item List |id=1730 |item= Burning Bow |slots=1 |simple=yes}} from a player. Make sure to use {{Item List |id=1752 |item=Fire Arrow |simple=yes}} with the {{Item List |id=1730 |item= Burning Bow |slots=1 |simple=yes}}.
** While heading towards Plagarism skill you will unlock {{Skill List |id=212 |skill=Back Stab |simple=yes}}, this even more useful with a dagger and particularly on non-aggressive monsters.
** A cheap version of an AOE attack is {{Skill List |id=214 |skill=Raid |simple=yes}}, simply use {{Skill List |id=51 |skill=Hiding |simple=yes}} then {{Skill List |id=214 |skill=Raid |simple=yes}} immediately after, (repeatedly) stunning targets around you and doing decent damage. Remember the Chon-Chons and Drainliars can see you while invisible (as can all Demons and Insects).
*** Again the alternative area is Beach Dungeon 3 where you will fight Thara Frogs and Megalodons. Use {{Item List |id=13000 |item= Jujube Dagger |simple=yes}} or {{Item List |id=1733 |item= Gust Bow |slots=1 |simple=yes}} and {{Item List |id=1755 |item=Arrow of Wind |simple=yes}} instead from Einbroch and or Players Respectively. (All of the above bows can be farmed but not until a higher level.)
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv. 71 -Lv. 85'''
** By this point you will have some points into {{Skill List |id=225 |skill=Plagiarism |simple=yes}}, use a good fire skill (copied from another player or a monster) to deal damage to the undead in Glast Heim.
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_70_-_79 Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest] in Glast Heim: Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Glast Heim Churchyard before you start hunting Wraiths and Evil Druids. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to instructor Ur. You will receive your third and final set of Eden Equipment from Blacksmith Thorn in the room behind the Blue Door.
** Doing this quest allows you to enchant your level 3 Eden weapon once with [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Weapons_Expert_BK Weapons Expert BK]
*I highly recommend [https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_71_-_85 Eden boards for levels 71-85] for this as you can take the quests monsters you will be killing anyway (Wraith and Evil Druid).
**Other easy monsters in this set include anything off the Juno/Yuno fields
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv. 80 - Lv. 89'''
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_80_-_89 Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest] Find Dispatched Instructor Kiren South of Einbroch. Hunt Porcellios, Venomous and Teddy Bears. Doing this quest instead of Gramps quests in Eden, allows you to enchant your level 3 Eden weapon once more.
*[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_86_-_90 Eden boards for levels 86-90] that I recommend doing are all Turtle Dungeon quests as it requires no map hopping, keep in mind these have a 3 hour cooldown.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv. 90 - Lv. 99'''
** [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_90_-_99 Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest] Find Dispatched Instructor Naomi at Ice Dungeon, hunt Siroma and bring back common loots from them as well as Milk and Sweet Sauce (can be bought from NPCs). Doing this quest instead of Gramps quests in Eden, allows you to enchant your level 3 Eden weapon once more (in addition to the level 80+ quest).
*[https://www.novaragnarok.com/wiki/Eden_Group#Level_91_-_99 Eden boards for levels 91-99] once again take the Turtle Dungeon quests again, for very little map hopping. These will be a bit harder as you are fighting multiple elemental monsters, each with different resistances to your auto spells. I recommend bringing a friend or 2.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Easy way - Gramps, Lv 85. - Lv. 99'''
** Join a party for the Gramps quests in Eden, using the #lfg channel or a chat room in Eden Headquarters, be very specific as to where you want to go and what level/class you are. Learn what elements the monsters are and how to counter them before entering as this will make your quest easier. 
*** Level range to join the first bracket of Gramps quests. Note that Gramps quests are rotated at the start of every month. You can also hunt them outside of Gramps map. Use the &lt;code>@whereis (monster name)&lt;/code> command to find out where a monster spawns.
** If you have Chosen the Tank Build, {{Skill List |id=151 |skill=Pick Stone |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=152 |skill=Throw Stone |simple=yes}} can become useful in Gramps to attract monsters without killing them, so your party can get their kill numbers up as well.
** {{Skill List |id=150 |skill=Back Slide |simple=yes}} will be great for tanking to move around while taking few hits, /bingbing and /bangbang bound to individiual keys will help with your turning.
** If you have Chosen the Arrow Build, you will need a lot of arrows and to {{Skill List |id=46 |skill=Double Strafe |simple=yes}} targets, as you will be classified as a damage dealer.
** If you have Chosen the Melee/Auto Spell Build, you will need to have DEX and INT at this point to do damage and will have to manually cast spells, but will not be able to {{Skill List |id=475 |skill=Preserve|simple=yes}} your skills just yet (if Rogue).
** As a Rogue with Melee Build, {{Skill List |id=214 |skill=Raid |simple=yes}} is still effective but to keep up to a moving party.

=== Rebirth 1/1 - 99/69 ===
* As a Novice, from Job Level 1 - 10, Fight some Porings or other weak monsters outside of Prontera (1-2 monsters). Make sure to apply your stat points first!
** Change job to High Thief.
* Next, do the [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village Quest].
** This will put you at Job level 50.
** Change job to Stalker.
* Turn in your Gramps quests to hit level 99/69.
** To make up the missing job level, turn in some previously held quests like bounty boards.

=== Lv 100+ (Shadow Chaser) ===
* '''Lv 100-114'''
** After hitting Shadow Chaser, make sure to get some job levels in Gramps, if the monsters are strong that time around you should tell your party you need to grab a stonger, third job skill to copy in order to continue. Your party members may have enough job levels to let you copy the wanted skill off of them, simply use turn on repoduce and use the duel feature to get hit with it and {{Skill List |id=2285 |skill=Reproduce |simple=yes}} again to lock it in.
**You may need to do Gramps quests again in order to hit level 115, so that is an opportune time to grab the skill you need. {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm |simple=yes}} and {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}} are good for the Arrow Build. 
**A lot of people will use {{Skill List |id=83 |skill=Meteor Storm |simple=yes}}  as their {{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=Auto Shadow Spell |simple=yes}} Build but keep in mind this is Fire element and as with any elemental skills, may not work on all monsters. 
** [[Banquet for Heroes]] quests after your second gramps (up to and including Ritual of Blessing and all kitchen quests) combined with [[Rock Ridge]] quest: Fistful of Zeny and [[Rock Ridge Daily Quests]] (Contract with the Wealthy Merchant) should bring you at or near level 115 for the next gramps sets.
*** Remember, Contract with the Wealthy Merchant is available daily for extra experience.
** Minimum level to access [[Sara's Memory]], [[Bangungot Hospital]].
*** You must complete [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Nurse_in_Port_Malaya Nurse in Port Malaya] quests to access [[Bangungot Hospital]]. 
*** For [[Sara's Memory]] I recommend a Water element skill 
*** Grab a Holy element skill for [[Bangungot Hospital]] (You will be fighting Demon class Enemies not undead)
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 115 - Lv 144'''
** Level range to join the second bracket of Gramps quests.
** By now it is mandatory to copy a third job skill to be effective.
*** for the Tank Build you can copy healing skills and royal guard damaging skills as you will probably have a shield. 
*** An Arrow Build should copy {{Skill List |id=2233 |skill=Arrow Storm |simple=yes}} or {{Skill List |id=2418 |skill=Severe Rainstorm |simple=yes}} if they intend to do damage or a Trap Skill if they've deviated into that type of skill build. 
*** {{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=Auto Shadow Spell |simple=yes}} Builds can copy nearly any Warlock or Sorcerer skill provided they have INT as the damage will be based off of that.
*** For those who have picked a STR based {{Skill List |id=2286 |skill=Auto Shadow Spell |simple=yes}} Build, Rune Knight and Guillotine Cross skills are available.

* '''Lv 100-110'''
** [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Leveling_Quests#Level_100-110 Gelkah's Quests] In Eden there are several NPCs in the back room near across from where you would get your Eden equipment. Talk to Gelkah for the first of many repeatable quests.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 111-120'''
** [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Leveling_Quests#Level_111-120 Mingmin's Quests.] Also in the back room of Eden.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 120-130'''
** [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Leveling_Quests#Monster_hunting Melody Jack's Quests.] Also in the back room of Eden.
** Minimum level to access [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]], [[Ghost Palace]]. 
*** For [[Nightmarish Jitterbug]] grab an Aoe Skill that is not Fire or Wind element as half of the monsters will only take half damage either way, Holy element is the way to go here.
*** For [[Ghost Palace]] grab Napalm Beat or Soul Strike and Soul Expansion or other ghost element skills and bring a ghost element weapon. Any elemental skill should work really these are just the most effective and easy to obtain.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 125'''
** Minimum level to access [[Airship Assault]], [[Devil's Tower]].
*** [[Airship Assault]] has a strong boss if you are near this level, he can be hurt by holy element skills although one type of monster in there is not hurt and is actually healed by this element.
*** In [[Devil's Tower]] all monsters but one are Dark element and will be hurt by Holy elemental spells.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 130-140'''
** [https://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Leveling_Quests#Level_131-140 Ragi's Quests.] These are quite hard and basically require parties or leeching off of others you know well but give good exp.
** Minimum level to access [[Old Glast Heim]] Normal Mode, [[Charleston Crisis]], [[Buwaya Cave]].
*** Again Holy elemental spells are effective in [[Old Glast Heim]] and are good as many monsters will use Agi Up, rendering normal attacks hard to hit with.
*** [[Charleston Crisis]] can make use of any element, go nuts!
*** [[Buwaya Cave]] will need a Wind element spell as all monsters there are Water element. Chain lightning and Varytyr spear are good AOE spells but may get you into trouble because of the way the instance works, try for single target spells.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 140'''
** Minimum level to access [[Horror Toy Factory]], [[Central Laboratory]], [[Malangdo Culvert]], [[Bakonawa Lake]].
*** You must complete [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village Cautious Village] and [http://irowiki.org/wiki/Bakonawa_Extermination Bakonawa Extermination] to access Bakonawa Lake.
** Minimum level to do [[Dimensional Travel]]. This is a pre-requisite quest to access [[Bios Island]].
*** [[Horror Toy Factory]] needs Holy element and anything other than Fire can be used against the Dark, Holy and Ghost element monsters.
*** [[Central Laboratory]] will have three unpredictable MVP characters and element here should be chosen to compliment your party members.
*** Fish monsters are mostly Water as is the case in [[Malangdo Culvert]], so bring your Wind spells.
*** As with [[Buwaya Cave]] this MVP is similar and needs Wind element spells to be deal good damage.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 145 - Lv 175'''
** Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests.
*** Proceed the same way you would as in earlier Gramps quests, find out the monsters before hand, your party compliments and role.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 145'''
** Minimum level to access [[Sarah and Fenrir]].
*** [[Sarah and Fenrir]] has strong Dark monsters that should be defeated for extra rewards, bring holy spells.
&lt;!--


-->
* '''Lv 160'''
** Minimum level to access [[Bios Island]], [[Morse Cave]], [[Temple of the Demon God]], [[Monster Hunter]], and [[Deserted Island]]. 
*** [[Bios Island]] has Earth, Fire, Water and Undead Monsters, wow most elements arent effective here, Holy should still be effective if you can deal the damage, but neutral may be the way to go.
*** [[Morse Cave]] has a large amount of Neutral monsters but Fire element spells should make short work of the Earth boss. Make sure you have ranged AOE spells here as you will be frozen in place for most of this and the boss's minions will pile up in one spot.
*** [[Temple of the Demon God]] and [[Monster Hunter]] have various monsters and will often require a full sized party to complete (12 and 5 respectively). Learn about your party members thoroughly and do not get in the way. If you can deal damage deal damage, tanks will tank of course.
*** [[Deserted Island]] has Water monsters, use Wind element spells here.
** Recommended level to try [[Old Glast Heim]] Hard Mode if you have not done so at this point.
***The same instance procedures as [[Old Glast Heim]] Normal, Holy elemental spells are effective in [[Old Glast Heim]] and are good as many monsters will use Agi Up, rendering normal attacks hard to hit with.
