<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Hi everyone, Leinarth here. I'm going to teach you what I learned during my stay on NovaRO about Dragon Knights. Here I will teach you about the most interesting builds I have the knowledge of. If there's an acronym you don't understand, you should check out the list I made at the bottom. If you have any questions, you may find me on Novacord under the name Leinarth. Feel free to PM me too, my discord tag is pimousse.
</p><p><b>Disclaimer: this guide is purely tailored for NovaRO and will not be fit for any other private server, and you may not redistribute it elsewhere, nor use it as a base for your own guide. Seriously, get creative by your own means.</b>
</p><p><br />
<a href="File_Warning.html" class="image"><img alt="Warning.png" src="../w/images/c/cb/Warning.png" decoding="async" width="40" height="40" /></a> A bit of news&#160;: The arrival of 4th classes and Dragon Knight means a lot of guide updating, for now the stats and skills are done and the gears (and potential builds) will come later.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats">Stats</span></h2>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> - Strength is crucial for damage, do not neglect it as a RK. It increases a lot Weapon ATK, and RKs mostly play with high ATK weapons like two-handed swords, so it's more than worth it.</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> - Agility should be usually high for all builds (except IB if you can't spam), since you need max ASPD for optimal DPS.</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> - Vitality increases your already great HP pool, don't forget that your HP gets nearly tripled under <img src="../images/skill/359.png" alt="359.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/359"><b>Berserk</b></a></span> (Interesting for sustain if you're playing Berserk).</li>
<li><b>INT</b> - Intelligence will increase your Enchant Blade damage, as well as your tiny SP pool. Do not hesitate to put some points here if you feel like you're often out of SP, or you'll have to play with mana potions.</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> - Dexterity is awesome in case you're playing a skill-based build like <img src="../images/skill/397.png" alt="397.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/397"><b>Spiral Pierce</b></a></span> or <img src="../images/skill/2006.png" alt="2006.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2006"><b>Ignition Break</b></a></span>, because you need to reduce the cast as much as possible (Instacasting is great for increasing your DPS).</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> - Luck will be really important if you're playing the Critical build, otherwise it's not something you should focus on.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="4th_Class_Characteristics_status">4th Class Characteristics status</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>POW</b> - Power directly impacts physical damage, and is taken into account as a multiplier in several DK skills; it is our main 4th class stat and thus must be maxed, yes even for the Dragon Breath build (more on that later in the Skills section).</li>
<li><b>STA</b> - Stamina increases RES (Physical Resistance), which reduces physical damage taken. This is not really interesting for us as our main concern is dealing damage.</li>
<li><b>WIS</b> - Wisdom increases MRES (Magic Resistance), which reduces magical damage taken. Same as above, none of our concern.</li>
<li><b>SPL</b> - Spell is the magic version of POW, and since we don't do any magic damage, we also ignore this stat.</li>
<li><b>CON</b> - Concentration is kind of the 4th class version of LUK as it increases various stats (HIT, FLEE, P.ATK and S.MATK). If you go for a non-critical build, this will be your second main stat.</li>
<li><b>CRT</b> - Creative is a weird stat which increases both the 40% base Critical Damage modifier (not the same mod as what we get from gears) and... H.PLUS for better heals. Forget that last part and pick up this stat as your second main one if you wish to go for a Critical build.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills">Skills</span></h2>
<p>Here we'll talk about what to level up in your skill trees, what skills are important; I'll give you what I leveled up but feel free to change it to your liking. This skill build is a versatile build intended to be used for all builds except the dragon skills, so this list might not be what you're looking for if you're going down the Dragon Breath path.

<td>The sweet melody of good ol' AGI knight buddy comes from this skill. It used to be a +30% ASPD bonus but since Renewal it has become a +7 flat ASPD bonus which lasts 300 seconds. You need this skill maxed first to be able to kill monsters quickly without relying on SP consumables. Don't forget to get the ASPD potion corresponding to your level for maximum sword-spamming in the enemies' faces. <b>Since the KRO Mass Skill Rebalance, this skill now gives in addition to the usual buff, +10% ASPD, and Crit and HIT per skill level, to a maximum of Crit + 12 and HIT + 20</b>.

<td>This skill is great for killing monsters in AoE, <del>though it gets sometimes another behaviour where only the monster you clicked on will get damaged and it'll get pushed bash far away; this is due to the gutterlines problem (Use your Google-fu and check it out if you don't know it)</del>. <b>Since the KRO Mass Skill Rebalance, there's no gutterline anymore, it has a 1 second cooldown and deals more damage with a two-handed sword.</b> On my current build I don't have it because I do not use it anymore (as a crit RK you mainly do single target DPS), to allow for more diversity in my build like the possibility of getting Spiral Pierce and a Peco Peco/Dragon. If you are leveling, you should of course take it for faster grinding.

</td>
<td>Spear Boomerang is optional, you can take it if you decide to have a multi-purpose build like me; I can take it thanks to the skill points I do not use for Bowling Bash since I don't use it anymore, and it adds a small amount of damage to the skill Hundred Spear (there's a 40% chance of casting it instantly after H-Spear Lv 10). If you will never use spears, you may redistribute these points somewhere else.

You can even tank several physical skills like Asura Strike or Spiral Pierce with it. Be careful though, it only lasts 60 seconds so don't forget to keep it always active, and also cast it before you use Berserk so you don't suffer too much early from your lack of DEF.

</td>
<td>Now we're talking&#160;! Berserk is pretty much the bread and butter of the Crit RK; you won't be able to do anything than attacking your enemies without skills, but you'll have&#160;:
<ul><li>Full recovery of your HP</li>

<li>+15% ASPD</li>
<li>Endure effect</li>

<li>Flee halved</li>
<li>DEF/MDEF reduced to 0</li></ul>
<p>It also drains your HP by 5% every 15 seconds, so don't forget to fall back once you get really low, that way you can wait for the effect to end, resplenish your SP to buff yourself again, Berserk again and get back into the fight. If the fight ends before your Berserk does, you can ask a Sorcerer to use Dispell on you or an AB to use Clearance (Use chatrooms/emoticons to talk in Berserk). Also, please do not forget that you can't level the skill until you're job 50 as a Lord Knight.

</td>
<td>This is the strongest offensive skill you unlock as a Lord Knight. It has proven itself back in pre-renewal in PvP and WoE as a frightening skill that could one shot lots of classes without enough PvP-tanking stuff, because it ignores Soft and Hard DEFs. It's still great in Renewal, and it's especially strong if you make your build based on this skill;&#160;% ranged damage bonuses and DEX will be this skill's friends.
<p><b>With the kRO MSR, Spiral Pierce's cast time has been quite reduced, both in FCT and VCT, as well as the After Cast Delay which got halved. The skill's special size penalty got improved and now the damage formula also depends on BASE LEVEL.</b>
Here's the old formula of the skill, taken from RMS (to give you an idea of how it works)&#160;:
</p>
<ul><li><code>Damage = [(80% of weapon's weight * (100%+ skill level*50%) + (round.down(STR/10^2) + Upgrade Damage) * size modifier (S 125%, M 100%, L 75%)) * card factors * element factors ]* 5 hits</code></li></ul>
<p>To summarize it up with the factors that increase its damage:
</p>
<ul><li>+% ranged damage bonus</li>
<li>Weight of your weapon</li>
<li>STR</li>
<li>+% damage cards</li>
<li>Elemental advantage</li>

</td>
<td>Basically the reason why you're called a Rune Knight, it allows you to create the runes you can consume as a RK. Each level unlocks a rune, and also increases the success rate of the crafting (starts at a 53% base rate and stops at a 71% base rate) so you should get it level max. The most important runes you should try to get are Turisus (Giant Growth), Asir (Fighting Spirit) and Rhydo (Crush Strike). The other runes are situational, you should first focus on creating a big supply of these 3 as you'll be keeping them up everytime because of how strong they are (except Rhydo, you should keep them for big monsters or when you need to end quickly a fight).
<p>If you want to know more about the runes, you should check out the section dedicated for it <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Leinarth%27s_Rune_Knight_Class_Guide.html#How_to_become_a_Rune_Craftsman_101">here</a>.

</td>
<td>This skill allows you to add your MATK as additional magic damage to your normal attacks, and it adds 200 MATK during the duration. This means you can directly add stat points into INT for damage, although some tests have shown that the upgrade in damage is quite small (Somebody tested the impact of MATK and saw a difference of 2-3K damage between 1 and 90 INT). Despite this, you should take it because for early game it'll give you a slight advantage on your normal attacks and later on it'll be useful for a shadow gear equipment that gives ASPD based on this skill.

</td>
<td>It's a quick ranged attack pretty useful early on for farming little monsters (especially if you have a Peuz set). It is one of the several builds possible on RK as this skill has great potential with its ability to crit and also the fact that there is an endgame weapon that heavily reduces the cooldown of it, making it spammable and damn strong.

<td>Full Throttle is a skill common to all 3rd classes that restores your life to the max, increases your stats by 20% temporarily while consuming a percentage of your max HP every second. Despite the fact that it seems really strong, you get a cooldown of 30 minutes on the skill, and at the end of the duration you'll get the Rebound status and become literally crippled; your movement speed decreases and your natural HP and SP recoveries are disabled. If you have skill points to spend, you should get it to level max or not at all because the first levels are pretty much crap. It can help you in a difficult situation if you're not under Berserk, or you can use it BEFORE Berserk to go fully on the offensive and hope you don't die before both the skill and Berserk's HP consumptions alongside the enemies' attacks slaughter you. If you end up leveling it, keep it for the MvPs.

<p>There are some quite rare cases where the rune fails and you won't get buffed. The success rate formula (considering <img src="../images/skill/2010.png" alt="2010.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2010"><b>Rune Mastery</b></a></span> is Lv10) is the following:
</p><p><code>[60 + Skill_Lv + (DEX + LUK) ÷ 20]%</code>
</p><p>Thankfully, it doesn't happen often as we have by default a very high success rate (95% if you have <img src="../images/skill/2010.png" alt="2010.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2010"><b>Rune Mastery</b></a></span> at Lv 10 and 1 in both DEX and LUK). Here is a list of what could happen if you failed the consumption of your rune:

<p>If at some point it looks like your runes have no effect, <b>please make sure your <img src="../images/skill/2010.png" alt="2010.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2010"></a></span></b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2010">Rune Mastery<b></b></a><b> skill is leveled (and obviously maxed out)&#160;!

<hr />
<p>Now it's time for the crafting part; we're going to see how it works, and how you can craft the most runes.
</p><p>The success formula is&#160;:
<code>[Base_Success_Rate + (DEX ÷ 30 + LUK ÷ 10 + JobLv ÷ 10) + Runestone_Bonus - Rune_Rank]%</code>
</p><p>Base_Success_Rate goes from 32% at <img src="../images/skill/2010.png" alt="2010.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2010"><b>Rune Mastery</b></a></span> Lv1, up to 50% at Lv10. So to get the best crafting rate, always make sure you got the skill maxed out. Keep in mind also that it affects directly the efficiency of the runes; if you have <img src="../images/skill/2010.png" alt="2010.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2010"><b>Rune Mastery</b></a></span> at a very low level or not even leveled at all, your runes will be extremely weak&#160;!
</p><p>If you're playing a Critical Rune Knight build, you may notice that it's much easier for you to craft them thanks to the high investment in the LUK stat. Otherwise if you're playing another build or simply want to minmax, you might want to register a crafting build with 130 DEX, 130 LUK, at the Build Manager in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Main_Office.html">Main Office</a> to get the highest success rate possible.
</p><p>The Rune_Rank penalty depends on the runestone you're crafting, it goes from 5% up to 20%, so as a rule of thumb, always keep the 20% penalty in your calcuations if you make a crafting build. Some people have reported having a better success chance increased their numbers of crafted runes, others said it was purely random, <b>needs to be tested thorougly.</b>
</p><p>To complete the formula, you'll need the success bonus from the rough runestone consumables, you can find it here&#160;:

<p>You'll also see that on the Rune Knight NPC's shopwindow in the Main Office, in addition to the roughstones he also sells Elder Branch, Light Granule and Gold. These are pretty expensive and you should always try to farm the components or at least always look up the price on the market, otherwise you will waste often a lot of money in the long run if you're lazy <del>like me</del>. Many thanks to Willi for sharing his farming spots&#160;!

<p>Here we'll see some basic stuff you can find on the floor at Prontera if you're lucky at that time or at a small price in the market (watch out for rip-offs&#160;!). There will be also mid-game equipment, and a few end-game items. <b>Please do not forget that if you are a total beginner and the equipments feel unobtainable at first on the market, you can keep playing with the Eden Gears until a higher level like 150 as they are reliable enough if you do all the quests at the Eden HQ, considering there are progression gears even for after level 99.</b>

<td>The chance of you using this card is pretty low simply because there aren't a lot of them on the server since it's quite new, they are currently expensive, but you could theorically get them for free if you farm Ghost Palace daily (you need 10,000 Gray Shards). It's one of the best card you can have for an evil cleansing purpose as it gives a neat ATK bonus and a big 30% increase in damage against Undeads and Demons.

It gives a 20% physical damage increase against medium and large monsters (most of the monsters you'll encounter mid to late game) and a small ATK bonus. If you're playing any one-handed weapon, you might want to get the combo with Khalitzburg Knight card which does the same in the defensive category, and getting the set will give you another 15% increase in damage. They cannot be dropped, but they can be crafted at the entrance of the instance Old Glast Heim against drops of the instance (it's much easier to create them with loots of the Hard Mode).

If you don't have any, you might want to get one of the cheapest for starters.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Builds">Builds</span></h2>
<p>Please do remember that there's not always a "BEST BUILD", and that all builds are viable. One may pop ahead of the rest and become "THE META" but it will also come accompanied by scarcity and high prices of the corresponding gears. All builds have different strengths and weaknesses, will peak in performance (and also differ in prices) at different steps of the game, from early to endgame.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_AA">Critical AA</span></h3>
<hr />
<p>Remember these wise words from your sensei:
</p>
<ul><li>The best defense is a good offense, and the best offense is a good ol' AA RK <a href="File_No1.html" class="image"><img alt="No1.gif" src="../w/images/1/16/No1.gif" decoding="async" width="40" height="40" /></a></li></ul>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="File_Rkberserk.html" class="image"><img alt="Rkberserk.gif" src="../w/images/5/52/Rkberserk.gif" decoding="async" width="498" height="266" /></a></div></div>
<p><a href="File_Warning.html" class="image"><img alt="Warning.png" src="../w/images/c/cb/Warning.png" decoding="async" width="40" height="40" /></a> Even though the Critical AA build that I'll teach you may seem appealing, please do not forget that's it's not easy to exp with it, especially if you follow the stats, which are given for level 175 (You'll get nowhere with 1 point in DEX if you don't have a great critical rate). You should first take a look at the Wind Cutter build as it's easier to do and it'll give you a spike in damage when leveling after switching to Rune Knight.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_2">Stats</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here are the stats I use for my Crit RK:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 120</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 100+</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 40+</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 1</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 120</li></ul>
<p>If you're not stuffed good enough yet or want to play solo without foods, AB buffs or a Minstrel, you might want to switch STR and AGI so you can get 190~ ASPD. This build has the goal of making the highest melee damage possible, and it's much better to get as much attack speed as possible before trying to upgrade your damage, since it outshines the little atk boost you get from the 20 last points you could put in STR.
</p>

<p>I'm not even kidding here, these are the only 3rd class skills you need to perform correctly as a Critical Rune Knight. Critical build is all about buffing before simply auto-attacking the enemy, no other skills required.
Of course, there are several 2nd class skills that you mustn't forget&#160;!
</p>

<p><b>RK November 2019 rework update:</b> Ignition Break and Sonic Wave will be able to crit, and Enchant Blade will get buffed, so don't miss out on these skills&#160;!
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>The strategy on a Critical build is pretty simple; buff yourself as much as possible before going Berserk and killing everything. The skills and buffs you need to cast before Berserk are better used in this order, because of their duration:
</p><p><code>Auto Berserk &gt; Berserk Potion &gt; Enchant Blade &gt; Two-Hand Quicken &gt; Aura Blade &gt; Turisus Runestone &gt; Asir Runestone &gt; Rhydo Runestone &gt; Concentration &gt; Parrying &gt; Magnum Break &gt; Berserk</code>
</p><p>This might seem like it's kind of useless but if the fight drags on, you're still under Berserk and your buffs start disappearing (like the runes for example), you will lose a big part of your DPS and end up waiting for Berserk to stop so you can buff again, making you possibly lose a lot of precious time.
</p><p>If you're simply killing lots of trash mobs, you could also forget Berserk as it could lead to your doom since you could get mobbed and get crushed because your FLEE is halved and you got 0 DEF/MDEF. This is something I try to avoid in Sky Fortress for example, as the Ragged Zombies there hurt quite a lot. Instead, switch to this combo:
</p><p><code>Auto Berserk &gt; Berserk Potion &gt; Enchant Blade &gt; Two-Hand Quicken &gt; Aura Blade &gt; Turisus Runestone &gt; Asir Runestone &gt; Rhydo Runestone &gt; Concentration &gt; Parrying</code>

<td>A fairly new set that is available through a custom beginner content, this practically free set will boost you in many ways: ATK, ASPD, critical damage... If you have no gears yet, going for this set will help you get more easily into midgame. My only issue with it if you're starting out is that it provides basically no critical rate, so you'll have to rely on other sources like your base LUK, buffs or manage to set in your stuff some crit rate equipments/cards. A good idea would be to combine it with the Fox Ear Ribbons which will solve all your crit rate issues in the beginning.

</td>

</td>
<td>The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP&#160;!. The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs&#160;! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight.

<td>This hat gives 10% ASPD bonus, and when you physically attack, you have a chance of transforming into Moonlight Flower: it gives you a %ranged damage bonus, and +100% critical chance. I've seen this hat being used sometimes on Crit RK builds so I thought I would add it here, but this isn't that worth it as there are many ways to achieve +100% critical chance. But it could still be viable since you'd free a lot of other equipment/card slots; you wouldn't need to get any critical bonus anymore, and you could theoretically invest strongly on pure power (like ATK). I consider them training wheels that will allow you to get a 100% critical rate until you get the items required to have it.

<td>This cute little buddy is your best early friend as it gives you the thief skill Double Attack at level 5. Since a patch from several years ago, you can both proc critical attacks and double attacks on the same hit. This is in my opinion core to the build as you get a big DPS spike thanks to your high ASPD and your already sky-high damage. Do not forget that also the Turisus rune sometimes doubles the damage of one of your hits, and <b>it stacks with Double Attack</b>. Yes, the quadruple attack spike is not a dream, and it's theoretically possible to use it on the dreadful Crush Strike rune.

The 2 other slots can be filled with more generic physical damage/tankiness enchants with several levels of strength to them; the most interesting enchants for us will be Wolf Orb (Warrior) for the huge amount of ATK, ATK% and Melee% it provides, or Wolf Orb (Physical Defense) because of how crazy the DEF bonus can be.

Unlike this last one who needs a special enchant in order to be unbreakable by itself, this one just needs to be refined to +9 for that. The Broadsword will get enchants later, which might make it worthwhile.

I'd recommend upgrading it to the Patent version as soon as you can, if you desire to go down this route.

Thanks to the changes to Turisus and Double Attack, this weapon somehow rose above Lindy Hop in both survivability and DPS on Medium enemies; however Rhydo is still a risky bet since it can still break your weapon, and the Lindy Hop still wins on Large monsters.

</td>
<td>The new two-handed sword contender from 17.1 seems able to overpower the Lindy Hop on specific cases, due to its +11 refine bonus which gives +20% damage against Small and Medium sizes. It has a low crit rate bonus but since we have access to Acute and the new Illusion critical enchants, it's not a big problem. It can also be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Illusion_Equipments_and_Enchants_(17.html">enchanted</a> pretty good with ATK% and %critical damage. While I heard it can beat higher refine Lindies, I believe that the fact it only has a %size damage increase against Small and Medium but not Large (which are a big part of the MvPs), makes me think it's not that interesting. <b>This weapon got a nice boost thanks to its new combo with the Clark Sidecap, allowing it to compensate its weakness on Large monsters by bringing a huge 4% large size modifier every 2 refines of the weapon.</b>
<p>Whether it is worth replacing a Snake Hat or an ORC, is something I am currently unable to say; we still lack data on the sword as too few people tried refining it, and I'll need someone to lend me one to be able to test. If you were to use this weapon, I'd recommend after checking out the overall bonuses the weapon and the hat give, to discard size modifier cards on your weapon (WK/CW) and go for something such as critical damage or ATK.

The SW% mod boost can still be found on several refine stages with a good quantity, and also accompanied by Storm Blast% mods. Refine-wise the bonuses end with a stronger crit rate amount compared to previously (10 more), and the old critical damage bonus has been replaced with Melee &amp; Ranged&#160;% mods.

<td>New versions of the Thanatos weapons appeared with the Thanos-AD series, and this weapon is the one for RK. It is a very weird combination of WC and AA, more about that in a bit: It gives a good amount of WC% skill mods and ATK per refine, as well as Melee, Size and more WC mods at specific refine stages. The weapon also weirdly has some Wind Cutter autocast feature when doing AAs. The HP/SP leech effect has sadly disappeared (Gravity probably considered it too powerful on endgame because it'd literally heal you full even with a small&#160;% amount) and has been replaced with some flat HP/SP regeneration. The grading on this weapon funnily enough is made for us AA users as it boosts Servant Weapon, thus boosting further our damage. It kinda is a janky fun weapon with its own potential; it helps the AoE clearing capacity of the build that would otherwise rely entirely on Storm Blast, and will also fully pierce DEF proving itself pretty neat if you don't have good DEF pierce for the enemies you're fighting and they have very high DEF.

<td>This shield is pretty neat as it's more focused on offensive than usual shields, because it gives 5% ATK and MATK; you'll get more bonuses if you manage to refine it to +7 and later but it's quite hard and expensive.

<td>A new shield that appeared with Episode 16.2; this shield is really awesome because it's kind of a jack of all trades. You get ASPD depending on the refine (5% at +0, can go as far as 10% at +9), and a Neutral reduction which works the same way as the ASPD bonus. I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK). This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players because of it's 10% DEF pierce bonus. <b>That bonus doesn't work on bosses&#160;!</b>

The difference in damage with a Temporal Agi Manteau is not that big so you may want to go for that one if you play multiple classes.

The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%). The last slot is negligible, being HP/SP/Heal power... Just try to aim for HP through the Wolf Orbs (Vital) and (Robust) if possible or if your survivability needs a boost.

The enchants that will be useful for us Crit RKs, are the Attack Speed and the Fatal modules. It is possible to enchant up to 3 times each accessory, so you can put one ASPD and one Fatal enchant on each of them, providing you a lot of ASPD and critical rate (very useful if you play for example the Royal Knight's Broadsword). The third slot is not as important, you may choose what you want to put on it, it's up to your preferences; I personally like using the drain modules which give you HP &amp; SP leech.

<li>Flash&#160;: When equipped with Speed of Light, increases critical damage by 30%. <b>While not as good as the Strong one (because size modifier is super interesting and critical damage is something we already have a plethora of), it is a great budget choice and Speed of Light boots work very well for tanking contents such as MH2.</b></li></ul>

</td>
<td>This set was during quite a while the main shadow set we had and it still is fairly easy to get in shape as it doesn't require any refinement; it provides 4 very interesting bonuses for us which are:
<ul><li>ASPD% and flat ASPD temporary buff when casting Enchant Blade based on Shadow Shield refine</li>
<li>Small chance to autocast Ignition Break while attacking</li>
<li>+10 All Stats&#160;: Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of stat reduction for our VCT&#160;!</li>
<li>+50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters&#160;: When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot&#160;!</li></ul>
<p>Keep in mind that while the bonus is great, you do not have any space left for other shadow gears. Also, this DEF pierce does not work on boss protocol monsters so beware&#160;!

<td>In case you really need a versatile and stronger DEF Pierce set that works on all kinds of <b>Normal</b> monsters, you may go for this one instead of the previous one; it will allow you to reach up to 80% DEF Pierce on Normal monsters if you refine all pieces to +10. You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party). The biggest issue with this set is the amount of shadow gears that require refinement, which sometimes require expensive components.

<td>Compared to the 2 previous sets, a smaller but more effective set exists, based on the 2 Penetration Shadow accessories. But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against <b>both Normal and Boss monsters</b>&#160;! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

<hr />
<div style="text-align: center;">WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH</div>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="File_Ryuwc.html" class="image"><img alt="Ryuwc.gif" src="../w/images/d/d0/Ryuwc.gif" decoding="async" width="500" height="500" /></a></div></div>
<p>If you're starting out as an RK, this is most likely the build you've been suggested. I recommend seeking out the Peuz's set as soon as you're 3rd class and can use the Wind Cutter skill, as the armor set is extremely powerful once you assemble it.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_3">Stats</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here are the stats I use for my WC RK:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 120</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 120</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 50+</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 1+</li></ul>
<p>When leveling, you should quickly aim to have 90 STR, AGI and DEX:
90 STR is easy to get and will allow you to dish enough damage for a while.
90 AGI will allow you to reach quickly the ASPD cap, especially if your ACD reduction is low (which means the ASPD cap is low too).
90 DEX is a must to be able to hit your enemies, because of their FLEE.
LUK is not a priority because <b>WIND CUTTER DOES NOT CRIT GUYS&#160;!</b>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_2">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Smash that Wind Cutter button and watch your allies cry in despair over your strong DPS, that's all you gotta do to win&#160;! <b>Since the new 2021 job improvement rework, if you want your spin to win to work properly, you need 185 ASPD and 40% ACD to spam like the wind&#160;!</b>
</p><p><a href="File_Spintowin.html" class="image"><img alt="Spintowin.png" src="../w/images/0/00/Spintowin.png" decoding="async" width="401" height="414" /></a>
</p><p>Don't forget that Wind Cutter is a swiss army knife, it changes depending on the weapon you are using, it can have 3 different ways of working&#160;:
</p>
<ul><li>With a two-handed sword&#160;: 2 hits instead of 1 hit, at a 1250% per hit skill modifier, and the skill will pierce DEF</li>
<li>With a spear weapon&#160;: the damage is considered ranged instead of melee, with a 2000% skill modifier</li>
<li>With other weapons&#160;: nothing specific, with a 1500% skill modifier</li></ul>
<p>Swapping to a spear can prove to be really helpful in situations where you go into an area with lots of monsters with the ability to reflect; this will allow you to bypass it entirely, at the cost of a weaker WC (because you lose the DEF pierce a 2HS provides with the skill). You will be able to escape a lot of deaths, and avoid spending money in Golden X to bypass the reflect.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Equipment_2">Equipment</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>List of the <b>key pieces</b> of equipment recommended for the Wind Cutter build. Don't forget that you can always take a look again at the General Equipment list, if some items here do not suit you or they are too expensive for you. I've also dropped some interesting cards for MH2 since I know a lot of you are reading this guide for its strong capabilities on that content.

<td>So this set which was pretty underwhelming at first, it ended up being extremely good with the new Wind Cutter rework because of its +100% bonus on the skill. You get an absurd increase in damage with it, and it's super cheap, making the build very cost effective for beginners. You'll lack ACD in the beginning though so the spam will be a bit slow, but it'll quickly get better. You can keep using this set while you improve the remaining gear slots, which will allow you to fill other damage modifiers and also take care of the ACD reduction.

</td>
<td>The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP&#160;! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats; this cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs&#160;! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight.

<td>Similar to its other Illusion counterparts, this hat can be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Illusion_Dungeons.html#Illusion_Enchants">enchanted</a> and you'll want to go for STR runes like explained above. The reason why you would go for this hat, outside of any reason concerning a specific kind of content like MH2, is that you lack ACD. This top hat is a huge source of ACD, as it can provide +12% ACD reduction when refined to +9. Combined with the all races bonus thanks to the runes of strength, it is a very powerful contender BUT it <b>will</b> get beaten by a Black Ribbon in terms of raw damage. Now we only require 40% ACD, so it's not recommended.

It can also be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Illusion_Dungeons.html#Illusion_Enchants">enchanted</a>, the most recommended enchant for us is the Powerful Nive which, depending on its level, gives a bonus of STR at a specific refine and an all races% bonus at a higher refine.

It also increases damage against angels and demons, which makes it good for this kind of hunting (pretty interesting for grinding at the actual place you get the armor from, Odin's Temple). If you get it +9, you can enchant it with a special enchant tied to the version of the soutane, which <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/310076/str-blessing">in this case</a> gives us STR, ATK%, DEF, MDEF and damage against all races. In total at +12 with the special enchant you get +33% ATK, +30 STR and +12% DMG against all races.

(The only place where it will not be performing good though is MH2 where its combo effect is halved).

<td>This two-handed sword is really nice for survival because it gives you a chance to regenerate a small part of the damage you do on a attack, including AoE attacks. If you have a Rideword Hat and a Hunter Fly Card in your weapon you'll regenerate lots of HP quite often with this weapon, making it one of the strongest sustain weapons. Since the new Ghost Palace update, you can also enchant your Thanatos weapon, you can get nice effects like an elemental enchantment (they're similar to Vicious Mind enchantments).

It gives a good amount of WC% skill mods and ATK per refine, as well as Melee, Size and more WC mods at specific refine stages. The weapon also weirdly has some Wind Cutter autocast feature when doing AAs, this may prove to come in clutch if you ever end up silenced and do not have Nosiege runes nor Green Potions thanks to that autocast (I have no idea about the&#160;% chance though). The HP/SP leech effect has sadly disappeared (Gravity probably considered it too powerful on endgame because it'd literally heal you full even with a small&#160;% amount) and has been replaced with some flat HP/SP regeneration. The grading on this weapon is clearly not interesting for us at it boosts Servant Weapon, hinting at a use for autoattacking. This weapon will become much stronger later on when we get access to Thanos Warrior Helmet (which will put it above the Vivatus Fides weapon described below).

<td>The Giant Snake Skins can be found in bulk because of the random refine &amp; stat enchants. It can be found for a cheap price in case it's full of random or not really good bonuses, or the price can skyrocket if it's a perfect one stat only GSS (DEX and INT GSSs are the most expensive ones). If you don't have any, you might want to get one of the cheapest for starters. The +10 MDEF is really neat and if you get a pair of Temporal Boots (any of the boots, even the basic ones should work), you'll also get a +15% HP and +5% SP set bonus. Try getting eventually a more expensive GSS with several STR enchants. You can also combo this garment with the Poison Breath hat for lots of neat effects. Beware as you might be lacking ACD reduction with this kind of garment&#160;!

<td>The muffler is the Episode 18 replacement for the Engine Wing B-Type, as it plays the same function of comboing with the physical armor for a 10% ACDr bonus. While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Melee% it brings. The second slot (which is the most interesting one I believe) can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Guide Attack), which can bring up to 24 Perfect Hit rate&#160;! This is extremely important for us on Wind Cutter as our main counter is very high FLEE which some monsters boast thanks to using the skill Agi Up. Perfect Hit will allow us to hit while ignoring FLEE, much like a Critical hit. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one.

</td>
<td>A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting groups of enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost is quite phenomenal; I'd recommend checking with a calculator if this would be stronger for you than Illusion Sprint Shoes as usually multiplcative modifiers tend to do better.

The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%). The last slot is negligible, being HP/SP/Heal power... Just try to aim for HP through the Wolf Orbs (Vital) and (Robust) if possible or if your survivability needs a boost.

<td>This accessory eliminates the need of Fly Wings or a Creamy card, and you can enchant it to get ACD reduction, up to a neat 10% reduction. While the accessory is easy to get (because you only need to complete the instance once), you need Shards of Gigantes to enchant the earring, which you can get from the instance or on the market. You can get more accessories by spending 1 Shard of Gigantes for each accessory, and you can also get a Left Earring if you want to have 2 of them at the same time.

And the one that interests us most is Fighting Spirit of course. Depending on the level you obtain it at, you can fetch up to 10% Melee damage and 5 Perfect Hit, so pretty much with 2 accessories with 2 perfect enchants each, that means 40% Melee and 20 P.HIT&#160;! This is very helpful in order to solve our troubles trying to hit high FLEE enemies. The third and last enchant will be one of the stats Wolf Orbs, you can try and aim for STR if possible.

The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25.

<hr />
<p>Here are the stats I'd use for an IB build:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 120</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 30+</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 30+</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 120</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 120</li></ul>
<p>We're of course putting 120 STR in this build because it relies heavily in ATK.
Not much AGI needed, since Ignition Break isn't fully spammable. You could get some though if you're planning on getting a high FLEE, but mob trains virtually destroy your FLEE so it's not that worth it. Only start getting some AGI once you get the CD reduction gears for IB.
The 90 VIT is there to help build up your natural HP pool, and also proc the effect of the Heroic Backpack.
This build is all about skill-spamming, so of course we're going to invest a bit of INT to get enough time for the Rideword to regen your HP and SP.
DEX is there at 120 for the cast of Ignition Break; this skill has only variable cast so you can reduce it a lot with stat reduction (Remember, int+dex*2=530 =&gt; Instant Cast IB).
LUK should be set at 120 for the critical chance, as well as the damage you get from investing into it with crit gears.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_3">Skills</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>So the skills you'll probably need as an IB RK, are approx the same as the Critical build except you get Ignition Break, the mounting skills from both LK and RK skill trees (speed is important when doing mob trains).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_3">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>If you want to level your char with the IB build and by doing mob trains, there are several things you need to know:
</p>
<ul><li>Don't face the mobs head on; always keep your distance, use Ignition Break before they get close to you so it hits and staggers them right before they hit you (that's called kiting).</li></ul>
<ul><li>You need to ALWAYS keep Concentration up (for the Endure effect). It will decide if you'll be able to get away from the monsters after getting attacked, or if the train stomps on you because you get stun-locked by the many monster hits.).</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you feel like you don't regen enough with the HP/SP leech equipments you got, you can try combining a Succubus/Incubus pet with more leech gears to further increase the chances of replenishing your HP/SP.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you die too much with mob trains, try getting a Priest friend or slave to use Kyrie Eleison on you. That way you can survive longer and train your kiting strategy.</li></ul>

<td>A fairly new set that is available through a custom beginner content, this practically free set will boost you in many ways: ATK, IB skill mod, critical damage... If you have no gears yet, going for this set will help you get more easily into midgame. My only issue with it if you're starting out is that it provides basically no critical rate, so you'll have to rely on other sources like your base LUK, buffs or manage to set in your stuff some crit rate equipments/cards.

The only downside of this armor is the lack of ATK bonuses, so it's really a compromise you need to decide on.

The 2 other slots can be filled with more generic physical damage/tankiness enchants with several levels of strength to them; the most interesting enchants for us will be Wolf Orb (Warrior) for the huge amount of ATK, ATK% and Melee% it provides, or Wolf Orb (Physical Defense) because of how crazy the DEF bonus can be.

You get ASPD depending on the refine (5% at +0, can go as far as 10% at +9), and a Neutral reduction which works the same way as the ASPD bonus. I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK). This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players.

<td>The Giant Snake Skins can be found in bulk because of the random refine &amp; stat enchants. It can be found for a cheap price in case it's full of random or not really good bonuses, or the price can skyrocket if it's a perfect one stat only GSS (DEX and INT GSSs are the most expensive ones). If you don't have any, you might want to get one of the cheapest for starters. The +10 MDEF is really neat and if you get a pair of Temporal Boots (any of the boots, even the basic ones should work), you'll also get a +15% HP and +5% SP set bonus. Try getting a GSS with several STR enchants for our IB build. If you're trying to push your critical rate but with a low budget, you can try getting a Green Maiden Card since it'll give you a lot of critical rate as your GSS will most likely be +10 or more, because they are dropped already refined up to +12 in the Faceworm's Nest instance.

Combine this with a Cursed Knight's Shield and you have 14% resistance to all elements&#160;! Quite the underrated garment in my opinion.

It can be as good as a +9 FAW with 3 Fatal3 enchants, but only if you equip a pair of Illusion Leg A to get the +10% Critical damage bonus from the combo, which allows it to reach the same critical damage potential as the FAW.

The second slot we will want the Wolf Orb (Critical) which can provide up to +15 Critical rate and +24% Critical damage.

<li>50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters&#160;: When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot&#160;!</li></ul>

You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party). The biggest issue with this set is the amount of shadow gears that require refinement, which sometimes require expensive components.

But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against <b>both Normal and Boss monsters</b>&#160;! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

<p>Some of you have been asking for it, and here it is&#160;! An unpopular yet efficient single-target ranged skill, that can actually go high in terms of DPS. Stay true to your Lord Knight roots and make Seyren proud&#160;!
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_5">Stats</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here are the stats for Spiral Pierce&#160;:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 120</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 120~</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 90~</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 90~</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 120</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 1</li></ul>
<p>We're of course putting 120 STR in this build because it relies heavily in ATK.
Close to 120 base AGI is necessary because we're looking for maximum spammability on this build.
The 90 VIT is there to help build up your natural HP pool, eliminate the stun possibility and also proc the effect of the Heroic Backpack.
Since this is all about skill-spamming, so of course we're going to invest a lot of INT to get enough time for the Rideword to regen your HP and SP, as well as helping reduce VCT.
We got 120 DEX to reduce the most possible the cast as well as eliminate FCT thanks to Temporal Dex Boots.
LUK should get the remaining points for a small ATK bonus.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_4">Skills</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>So this could be simply played like other skill-focused builds where you only focus on a single skill (which here is Spiral Pierce of course), but you may also level other 3rd class ranged skills like <img src="../images/skill/2002.png" alt="2002.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2002"><b>Sonic Wave</b></a></span>, <img src="../images/skill/2004.png" alt="2004.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2004"><b>Hundred Spear</b></a></span> and <img src="../images/skill/2008.png" alt="2008.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/2008"><b>Dragon Breath</b></a></span>.
Another good addition would be <img src="../images/skill/57.png" alt="57.png" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://divine-pride.net/database/skill/57"><b>Brandish Spear</b></a></span> since it's ranged since the skill rework, and scales off STR.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_4">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>It is mostly going to revolve around spamming Spiral Pierce, so I'd recommend setting your Spiral Pierce hotkey on Smartcast mode in NovaExt.
If you don't know how to do that, you might want to read the tutorial <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="NovaExt.html">here</a>.
If you feel like you don't regen enough with the HP/SP leech equipments you got, you can try getting a Succubus/Incubus pet to further increase the chances of resplenishing your HP/SP.
</p><p>Spiral Pierce is a skill that requires 86% ACD for maximum spam.

The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP&#160;! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats; this cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs&#160;! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight. Feel free as well to swap the Powerful Nives on armor and shoes for Dexterous Nives if you have some issues with Cast Time.

<td>The Giant Snake Skins can be found in bulk because of the random refine &amp; stat enchants. It can be found for a cheap price in case it's full of random or not really good bonuses, or the price can skyrocket if it's a perfect one stat only GSS (DEX and INT GSSs are the most expensive ones). If you don't have any, you might want to get one of the cheapest for starters. The +10 MDEF is really neat and if you get a pair of Temporal Boots (any of the boots, even the basic ones should work), you'll also get a +15% HP and +5% SP set bonus. You could look for a cheap GSS with a combination of DEX and INT if you want to get easy IC.

While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Melee% it brings. The second slot (which is the most interesting one I believe) can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Guide Attack), which can bring up to 24 Perfect Hit rate&#160;! This is extremely important for us on Spiral Pierce as our main counter is very high FLEE which some monsters boast thanks to using the skill Agi Up. Perfect Hit will allow us to hit while ignoring FLEE, much like a Critical hit. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one or (Dex) if you need to reduce your cast time.

<td>A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting groups of enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost is quite phenomenal; I'd recommend checking with a calculator if this would be stronger for you than Illusion Sprint Shoes as usually multiplcative modifiers tend to do better. Same as above, these boots do not have integrated FCT reductions so you will need something else to take care of it, like the Casting Onyx costume enchant for example.

<td>Another pair of stats boots just like above, this one is an interesting alternative for us because of the huge quantity of DEX it brings, and there's a bit of strategy tied to it: You can exploit this to completely disregard the need of stacking DEX in your gears, only relying on your base 120 DEX (which with this setup, is not even needed to be kept that high except for HIT reasons) because getting that 175 bonus DEX will allow you to clear completely your VCT through stats. Yes you'll have a dirty cast time when the boots do not proc and that will make it awful to proc, but what if I told you there's an alternate way to deal with that&#160;? If you possess a Vernan, you can simply spam Sonic Wave pretty fast since the skill has no cast time and you have the reduced CD and more than enough ACD% reduction; you will thus manage to easily proc the big DEX boost, and can safely switch back to Spiral Pierce.

The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%). You could also get the Wolf Orb (Fixed Casting) but we have a lot of other ways to get that nowadays so I wouldn't recommend it. The last slot is negligible, being HP/SP/Heal power... Just try to aim for HP through the Wolf Orbs (Vital) and (Robust) if possible or if your survivability needs a boost.

And the one which interests us the most is Expert Archer. Depending on the level you obtain it at, you can fetch up to +10% Ranged damage and +20 HIT, so pretty much with 2 accessories with 2 perfect enchants each, that means +40% Ranged and +80 HIT&#160;!

The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25.

<td>Alongside the big Ancient Juperos custom episode came lots of new shadow gears, and part of them are combined versions of the previous single racial pierce gauntlets, which allows you to have one piece doing 2 races at the same time. This could be fairly useful for example in the Thanatos Tower instance (and upper floors 11 and 12) where Demon and Angel monsters roam together.

<p>You've been looking for a ranged build because you've tasted too much melee reflect&#160;? You still wanted to use a critical build because stacking HIT with Spiral Pierce ain't your cup of tea&#160;?
Look no further, Sonic Wave is here to fill that void in your heart&#160;!
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_6">Stats</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here's an average stat setup for SW that you can use:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 120</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 40+</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 1</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 120</li></ul>
<p>Yes you may think it is very similar to the Critical AA build if you've played it, which means it is totally compatible as a build swap&#160;!
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_5">Skills</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Skill-wise, we find yet again the usual buffs any physical RK will want:

</p><p>The reason why we want Enchant Blade here even if it doesn't bring any damage bonus to skills, is if you wanna one day use the <b>Rune Knight Shadow Shield</b> for the attack speed bonus it provides temporarily when casting Enchant Blade.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_5">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here we get the same usual buff routine for physical RKs like the other builds:
</p><p><code>Auto Berserk &gt; Berserk Potion &gt; Enchant Blade &gt; Two-Hand Quicken &gt; Aura Blade &gt; Turisus Runestone &gt; Asir Runestone &gt; Concentration &gt; Parrying &gt; Magnum Break</code>
</p><p>RK is a class that becomes a powerhouse all thanks to its buffs, so never forget them&#160;!
</p><p>Sonic Wave is a skill which requires 50% ACD for maximum spam <b>when using a Vernan to remove most of the cooldown</b>, otherwise it's not necessary to get ACD.

This weapon used to be the most endgame two-handed sword we could get, and had the right to stay at the n°1 spot as a weapon for RKs thanks to all the pros it has. It has the most ATK out of all 2HS, has 2 slots, gives ATK% and ASPD% bonuses based on the refine, is indestructible (goodbye Golem Card), and is enchantable twice (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Malangdo_Enchant.html">Malangdo Enchant</a>. Getting a Lindy past +10 used to be every main Crit RK's goal (You can settle for a +8 if you find it too hard or too expensive to go further in the refine hell). You'll want to get Sharp enchants on this one, except if you're already set crit-wise, in that case you may go for Expert Archer enchants.

You get ASPD depending on the refine (5% at +0, can go as far as 10% at +9), and a Neutral reduction which works the same way as the ASPD bonus. I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK). This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players because of it's 10% DEF pierce bonus. <b>That bonus doesn't work on bosses&#160;!</b>

</td>
<td>This used to be, and still is a very good pair of boots for critical builds as it gives a whooping 30% critical damage bonus. The enchants are going to define the price of your boots (if you want to buy them instead of crafting them); what you want at least is to get ASPD4 if you're lagging behind on your ASPD, or EA4 for raw damage. After that, pretty much any special enchant works for a RK (except Muscular Endurance and Runaway Magic).

SoL allows you to dodge half the hits thanks to the P.Dodge proc (Perfect Dodge is halved in MH2), giving you an easier time tanking there, as well as lowering a bit the stress and burden on your healer.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4879/hawkeye">Hawkeye</a> can be quite useful if you're looking for another way to get max ASPD as it gives you +200 DEX so you'll get quite a few ASPD points and a bit of damage.

</td>
<td>A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, it is simply interesting because of our usual high STR scaling through Weapon ATK with our big weapons.

<li>ASPD% and flat ASPD temporary buff when casting Enchant Blade based on Shadow Shield refine</li>
<li>+10 All Stats&#160;: Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of status reduction for our VCT&#160;!</li>
<li>+50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters&#160;: When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot&#160;!</li></ul>

You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party).

The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

<p>You feel like RK is not naturally bulky enough&#160;? You want to leave all the job to your dragon while you chill hard&#160;? You wanna take a shower of monsters and still not give a damn&#160;? Then this might be for you&#160;!
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_7">Stats</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here's an average stat setup for DB that you can use:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 30+</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 30+</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 120</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 120</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 120</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 1+</li></ul>
<p>It is interesting to get just a bit of STR to increase your maximum weight for carrying pots and farming.
You will want a little bit of AGI for faster animation when getting fairly well geared, this is not a priority at all though.
VIT and INT are necessary for the damage of Dragon Breath since it is based on HP and SP.
DEX is there of course to reduce heavily the cast time.
LUK won't bring much benefit to us, so leave it alone except if you wanna push it to 90ish and get close to Curse immunity, but you probably won't have enough points for that.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_6">Skills</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>These are the skills we want to pick as DB RK:
<a href="File_Dbknightskills.html" class="image"><img alt="Dbknightskills.png" src="../w/images/6/61/Dbknightskills.png" decoding="async" width="540" height="398" /></a> <a href="File_Dbrkskills.html" class="image"><img alt="Dbrkskills.png" src="../w/images/5/55/Dbrkskills.png" decoding="async" width="541" height="397" /></a>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_6">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Dragon Breath by default only has access to Fire and Water elements, but thanks to the update on the runes, you can now get several different elements through them. Dragon Breath (Fire) can become Holy through Turisus, and Shadow with Lux Anima. Dragon Breath Water can become Ghost with Asir, and Neutral with Lux Anima. Please remember that Lux Anima will overwrite both Turisus and Asir, so this is kind of a weakness this rune has for us DB users as sometimes we will be forced to not use it in order to hit some elemental monsters.
</p><p>One easy path when starting on this build is to heavily stack sources of HP and SP leech, in order to proc them on packs of monsters with the AoE of Dragon Breath; this will allow you to survive even longer on top of your already sky high health pool.
</p><p>Dragon Breath is a skill with a long ACD of 3 seconds for which we need a reduction of 96% for maximum spam; this is however hindered by the fact that DB has a hard animation delay, which prevents you from spamming faster even with the reduction amount reached. The only counter measure to this is to perform "dancing" (aka animation cancel by moving) or to get swarmed by monsters to get your animation cancelled by their hits.
</p><p>One more thing to remember: thanks to Dragonic Aura as a Dragon Knight, the 3rd class skill Dragon Breath gets a big boost from POW and P.ATK, so Level 5 weapons have a stronger impact than you might think if you refine them high because of the P.ATK added every refine.

<td>This set was some time ago a staple in both tanking and DB builds, it still works wonderfully today. This will give you everything you want on such a build: ACD, FCT reduction and HP. All these bonuses appear when the set is heavily refined, and you'll absolutely want to enchant each piece of the set with Stamina/Dexterous Nives (Lv2 if possible) to get a huge HP/ranged bonus at +11; it is possible to get two on each piece.

<td>The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots (So possibly 2 Stamina Nives Lv2, +14 VIT and +14% MHP or Dexterous Nives if you need some Ranged% and DEX for the cast time), and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP&#160;! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Stamina Nives but they can be enchanted with some DEX to help us with cast time reduction. This cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on.

It also brings a very sweet 15% all size reduction at +9, which synergizes well with the new DK passive Two Hand Defending (it gives some additional size resistance). Since this is a level 5 weapon it has grades, and very interesting ones at grades C and B: %ranged damage is always welcome, the new RES &amp; MRES stats will help you stay alive against future difficult contents, and the bonus size reduction will be a nice addition to DK's bulkiness.

Hitting more monsters means you're repeating the probability several times, and it ramps up the chance of making the card proc; add this card to a Thanatos Weapon and use a Rideword and you'll notice you get full health in no time while killing monsters, basically making you unstoppable machine that does not need a support or potions.

It also gives you a bit of ACD% reduction which is neat. The big issue with those boots as you may have noticed, is that it does not provide any FCT reduction.

The last slot is actually pretty important for us for once, we want to go for Wolf Orb (Robust) as it provides both great amounts of HP&amp;SP, and it will in most builds boost the damage more than Vital or Mental.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hundred_Spear">Hundred Spear</span></h3>
<hr />
<p>The most thematic spear build of Rune Knight, this lightning fast AOE ranged attack is a great tool for farming packs of monsters.
Currently WIP&#160;!
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_8">Stats</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here are the stats for Hundred Spear&#160;:
</p>
<ul><li><b>STR</b> 120</li>
<li><b>AGI</b> 90~</li>
<li><b>VIT</b> 90+</li>
<li><b>INT</b> 50+</li>
<li><b>DEX</b> 120</li>
<li><b>LUK</b> 90~</li></ul>
<p>We're of course putting 120 STR in this build because it relies heavily on ATK.
Only around 90 AGI because of the big cooldown this skill has, even with the gear reductions.
The 90 VIT is there to help build up your natural HP pool, help eliminate the stun possibility.
We mostly increase INT to have a bigger SP pool, considering the casting time of HS is extremely low by default.
We got 120 DEX to reduce further the cast time and most importantly build up our HIT rate.
LUK will also help us get more HIT rate.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_7">Skills</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Since this is a spear-only build, it is highly recommended that you take Dragon Training and get a mount so that you do not suffer from size penalty. Do not forget also to level up Spiral Pierce as its level is part of the formula of Hundred Spear. You'll want also to level up Charging Pierce for the occasional boosted damage every 11th attack, and Dragonic Breath since it allows you to build up AP, eventually to be able to cast Dragonic Aura which boosts temporarily Hundred Spear.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_7">Strategy</span></h4>
<hr />
<p>Hundred Spear is a skill with 0.5s ACD, but it is not necessary to reduce it because at the time of writing this, there is no gear combination that allows players to drop the CD of Hundred Spear from 3s to below 0.5s. However if you feel like maximizing your damage output then maybe you can mix up some another skill (Spiral Pierce&#160;? Dragonic Breath&#160;?) during the cooldown of HS, and get some ACD&#160;% reduction.

<td>The Illusion Sprint combo between the Mail and the 2 accessories (Ring and Glove) is actually a very interesting underdog option. The armor by itself offers 12% ACD and a few VIT points as well as 2 Nive slots on which you can put Powerful Nives for up to +14% damage to all races, and can be comboed with the 2 accessories for a whooping +15% max HP/SP&#160;! The Illusion Sprint Ring comboes with the Mail for 10% more ACD reduction, and comboes with the Illusion Sprint Glove for 5% more ACDr (the Glove itself giving 3% ACDr). The accessories cannot have Nives but they can be enchanted with some stats; this cheap 3-pieces set will bring you a total of 30% ACD which will help you reaching high amounts of ACDr early on. You can then combo these pieces with the Shoes as well, which will bring a lot to the table as well: +10% ATK, +70 ATK, +25% damage against bosses when comboing the Mail and the Shoes, then with the Shoes and the accessories you will get some on-hit chances to gain the gigantic +150 STR and +150 AGI buffs&#160;! Beweare though, the combo of the shoes with the accessories will continuously drain your HP and SP, so you might want to have some swap equipment to avoid losing HP&amp;SP when not fighting, and bring some leech effects if you plan on using this combo so you can regenerate in the middle of the fight. Feel free as well to swap the Powerful Nives on armor and shoes for Dexterous Nives if you have some issues with Cast Time.

<td>It's the same as the Pitman one but without the HIT part, except it has a combo with the Raydric Card which will make you much tankier&#160;: +10% Neutral Resistance (Raydric already gives +20%) and +5% more ATK. The ATK part of the combo is pretty neat because it compensates for the loss of a damage card on the garment slot like Brown Rat Card or Wakwak Card.

I consider it as good as the Mad Bunny, but for other purposes; it all depends on your needs (ASPD or more ATK). This shield is outshined by Cursed Knight's Shield on low DEF monsters, but it's a great way to increase your DPS on all high DEF monsters and players.

While it may not surpass the Str Manteau in both ACD% reduction and damage, it wins in utility (and ultimately damage, you will see why). The enchant slots are very different: on the 1st one we'll want the Wolf Orb (Powerful) which will be our main enchant source of damage upgrade with the Melee% it brings. The second slot (which is the most interesting one I believe) can be enchanted with Wolf Orb (Guide Attack), which can bring up to 24 Perfect Hit rate&#160;! This is extremely important for us as our main counter is very high FLEE which some monsters boast thanks to using the skill Agi Up. Perfect Hit will allow us to hit while ignoring FLEE, much like a Critical hit. Finally, the third slot is a fairly minor boost, it's recommended to go for Wolf Orb (Str) on this one or (Dex) if you need to reduce your cast time.

<td>A new pair of stat boots that was added with Airship Crash, these give a bit of ATK, HP and SP based on the refine of the boots which ain't crazy for lvl 5 boots. The main attraction comes from the potential proc when dealing damage which will grant a whooping +175 STR for 10 seconds, basically permanent when continuously hitting groups of enemies (kinda like the Illusion &amp; Automatic procs). The STR boost can be increased through grading. While this gives no interesting modifier like the other previous boots, the STR boost is quite phenomenal; I'd recommend checking with a calculator if this would be stronger for you than Illusion Sprint Shoes as usually multiplcative modifiers tend to do better.

The second enchant only has FCT, magic damage or physical damage enchants so we will go for the physical one, Wolf Orb (Physical Force), which provides a good amount of the size% modifier (up to +16%).

<td><b>I will only put here the Ruby version of those accessories, but you can also go for the Zircon or Aquamarine versions.</b> New accessories coming out of the Thanatos Tower revamp update, they bring out a huge amount of ATK% both by themselves and through their enchants; it is possible to get up to 10% ATK on each, and you can also get a very big racial bonus towards Angels and Demons. You can increase further the racial damage with the pair set bonus. This only gives 0.2 FCT with the combo but if you're running already FCT elsewhere, this won't be an issue for you.

<td>Those Episode 18 accessories are quite the opposite of the other Gray Wolf pieces, in the sense that we get more freedom enchants wise when comparing to Automatic, for a single reason&#160;: we can get twice one of the typical enchants like Fighting Spirit/Spell/Expert Archer. And the one which interests us the most is Expert Archer. Depending on the level you obtain it at, you can fetch up to +10% Ranged damage and +20 HIT, so pretty much with 2 accessories with 2 perfect enchants each, that means +40% Ranged and +80 HIT&#160;! This is very helpful in order to solve our troubles trying to hit high FLEE enemies. The third and last enchant will be one of the stats Wolf Orbs, you can try and aim for STR or DEX if possible.

<ul><li>ASPD% and flat ASPD temporary buff when casting Enchant Blade based on Shadow Shield refine</li>
<li>+10 All Stats&#160;: Very welcome stats as we get a bit more strength and tankiness, and most importantly a lot of status reduction for our VCT&#160;!</li>
<li>+50% DEF Pierce on Normal Monsters&#160;: When you get closer to endgame and start entering areas such as Einbech Mine 3, you'll have quite the hard time trying to one shot these monsters, the reason being they have high DEF. 50% pierce is not perfect but it helps a lot&#160;!</li></ul>

You'll only require then something like Expiatio to reach full pierce on everything (or pick up some specific racial pierce gears to complete the missing pierce amount if you dislike using an alt or playing with a party).

But in this case it comboes with a shadow weapon tied to a specific race, allowing a complete DEF pierce on that race, against <b>both Normal and Boss monsters</b>&#160;! The only prerequisite to getting that bonus is to have the sum of the refines of the 3 pieces to reach 25. Considering you will probably want several racial sets, it is thus recommended to refine the 2 Penetration accesssories to +10 because of their cheap refine cost as older gears, compared to the racial gauntlets that require more expensive, endgame components, and leave that last part only refined to +5.

<p>The easiest way to level up as a Swordsman/Knight, is to go down the AGI path. Make sure you level first your STR and your DEX to 50, then increase your AGI to 90. When you're finished with AGI, get your DEX to 70 and max your STR and AGI.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Lv 1+</b>
<ul><li>First thing to do if you haven't done the tutorial: Go kill some Porings in Hidden Dungeon to get Job Lv 10 and switch to Swordsman, then start grinding at Payon Cave. It is advised that you use your Novice Potions here if you got any, because your HP pool is very low at the beginning; Red Potions will do in case you didn't do the tutorial. Since the Renewal update the Zombies are much weaker so kill them first to get a few levels. Once you get around level 10-15, start killing the Skeletons and the other monsters.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 26+</b>
<ul><li>When you think you're doing fine at Lv 1 of the dungeon and the pace is getting slower, go straight to Lv 2. The skeletons are now much weaker compared to their old self years ago in Pre-Renewal.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 45+</b>
<ul><li>At this level I usually go to Orc Dungeon and kill groups of Orc Zombies with AoE skills. <i><b>If you want to grind faster, you may use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12114/elemental-converter-fire">Fire Elemental Converters</a> since the monsters here are weak against Fire. It'll be also useful later at Glast Heim, where you'll be hunting Evil Druids and Wraiths.</b></i> If you're between level 50 and 59, you can try the Eden quests for the Orcs if you want to get a free leveling bonus in Orc Dungeon: Go to Eden, talk to Secretary Lime Evenor to register, then you can ask Instructor Boya to test you, you should get the Orc Dungeon quest. Don't forget talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Orc Dungeon before you start hunting Orc Zombies and Orc Skeletons. When you've completed them, report to the Eden Group Member then to Instructor Boya. Since you passed the test, you'll have access to some special equipments for beginners, available by talking to Administrator Michael in the equipment storage room. If there' something you don't understand, you should check out the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html">Eden Group wiki page</a>.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>Here we'll keep doing the Eden quests since they give out nice EXP, and you get access to better items: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html#Level_70-79">Instructor Ur's Eden Equipment Quest</a> at Glast Heim. I recommend here that you also get the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html#Level_71_-_85">Hunting Board Quests</a> for both Evil Druid and Wraith. This way you kill 2 birds with one stone, or rather you earn twice EXP with one hunt.</li></ul></li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Talk to the Eden Group Member outside of Glast Heim Churchyard before you start hunting Wraiths and Evil Druids. Watch out for Mimics there since they're quite nasty and will easily kill you if you aren't prepared. Most players do this quest too while leveling, so do not hesitate to ask other players if they want to team up, it'll make your hunting quest faster and safer. Also do not forget that you have to kill 20 Wraiths first, talk to Johan, then you can kill the Evil Druids. You may then talk to Johan again, then go see Instructor Ur and Administrator Michael to get your rewards.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Lv 85+</b>
<ul><li>Level 85 is the minimum level required to join the first bracket of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Leveling_Guide.html#Gramps">Gramps quests</a>. Gramps quests are usually rotated at the start of every month, so try to end your quest before that. It is highly recommended that you do the Gramps quests whenever you can if you want to level as fast as possible. Once per day is already good enough but if you want to tryhard even further, the cooldown resets after 4 hours once you've turned in the quest (you can still go back in Gramps' map and grind without the quest). You can stay here until level 115 (the other Gramps map) if you want.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 99</b>
<ul><li>This is where it gets really important: if you want to "skip" the transcendent 2nd leveling phase, you can do a simple trick that consists of doing high-level quests when you're at level 99, and get the experience rewards only after rebirthing to level 1. This is what I usually do&#160;:
<ul><li>Get level 99 at Gramps 85+, but I do not turn in the two 400-monsters hunting quests.</li>
<li>Do <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village">Cautious Village</a> and stop before the king's reward (Watch on the link where you get the EXP and stop doing the quest before getting it, where you stop isn't really important).</li>
<li>Rebirth, then kill some Porings to switch to High Swordsman.</li>
<li>Turn in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village">Cautious Village</a>, you should get around Base Level 70 and Job Level 50, you can then change to Lord Knight.</li>
<li>After becoming Lord Knight, go turn in the Gramps quests at Eden, you should be somewhere close to 98/69. You can then finish your levels at Gramps 85+, or go to Rock Ridge and go east to kill the cowboy buffalos; the Shotgun Buffalo gives like triple the job exp of the other monsters, so focusing them will make your last levels faster. You're finally 99/70&#160;? Congratz&#160;! You can go to the Main Office and become a Rune Knight. <i>Do not worry about your level progression bar not reappearing, it's just a visual bug; you can disconnect and reconnect to make it appear again.</i></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Once you become a Rune Knight, your primary goal should be to <b>get Wind Cutter as soon as possible</b>, because it's your <b>best early AoE skill with a Peuz set</b> thanks to its amazing set bonus, it will help a TON for leveling. Also, don't forget that you can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/12208/battle-manual">Battle Manuals</a> to get a big increase on Eden board quests and Gramps quests.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Lv 100</b>
<ul><li>At this level I always do the Rock Ridge main quest <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Rock_Ridge.html#Fistful_of_Zeny">Fistful of Zeny</a>. It gives enough exp to get your first skill points, you get a free accessory good enough for beginners, and it's pretty easy to do. You may also do the daily quests for quick EXP everyday.</li>
<li>Once you finished Rock Ridge, you can start doing the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Banquet_for_Heroes.html">Banquet for Heroes</a> quests. You only need to walk and talk to NPCs until you get to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Banquet_for_Heroes.html#Room_of_Consciousness">Room of Consciousness</a>. This quest which contain an instance, will be too hard for you even though it's available at lvl 100; you need to ask for help from someone strong enough to solo it on #lfg. Once you've finished these, you may do the Royal Families quests and the dailies if you're still not 115. Another possibility is grinding at the ruins of Juperos, the dungeon is full of Venatus; you can start training your kiting skills here with Ignition Break, as they are quite unforgiving in mob trains since they are so many in there. It is recommended that you stay with the Neutral element as the Venatus have different elemental properties, depending on their color.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 115+</b>
<ul><li>When you get level 115, you can join the 2nd Gramps map and do the 400 mobs quests again there. If you want to get quickly to the 145+ Gramps tier, try getting an HE Battle Manual as it triples the EXP you earn; it only lasts 15 minutes so try to use it near the end of your 115+ Gramps run.</li>
<li>If you're not satisfied with Gramps, you can always go back to Juperos. If the Venatus do not give much EXP anymore, you can try out Rachel Sanctuary with the Vanberks and Isillas. They're easier to kite than Venatus since they're much slower so you shouldn't have too much trouble there. Your only doom here is the Hodremlin, it bites hard; try to avoid it or take more distance between the mob train and yourself so you can have some time to kill the Hodremlin.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 145+</b>
<ul><li>Level range to join the third bracket of Gramps quests. The third map of Gramps should be pretty fast as there is usually a level max doing the map for one of his characters or friends in the team.</li>
<li>You may also join the Charleston Crisis teams who run quite often the instance, to start farming up some items for your stuff (if you plan on getting an Excellion Suit) or to get money, while increasing your levels.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 160+</b>
<ul><li>At this level, you're pretty close to the max level (175), and you'll be able to join all the instances without prerequisite. Running them is a quick way to get the max level, as well as starting to farm for your items. What I usually do here, is run Room of Consciousness, Nightmarish Jitterbug, Charleston Crisis, Ghost Palace, Old Glast Heim Normal. If you cannot get into an instance team, go back to Gramps' 3rd level.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 175</b>
<ul><li>You did it&#160;! Finally you're level 175, I'm proud of you grasshopper&#160;:&gt;. It is now time to farm your stuff, and join bigger instances like Bios Island, Morse Cave, Temple of the Demon God, Old Glast Heim Hard... The rest is up to you&#160;! <i>If there are things you still don't understand or need more information, feel free to PM me on Discord (my ID is at the top of the guide).</i></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 175+</b>
<ul><li>If you are well-stuffed, you can try accessing some old endgame PvM contents such as Magma Dungeon F3, the Illusion Dungeons, Abyss Glast Heim, Gramps 175+... Another slower way is to keep on doing instances, because they usually reward you a nice amount of EXP either when you clear them or when you kill the MvP. <b>Be careful as getting past level 175 is not needed for most contents and is usually pretty HARD on the new players. At this stage, I'd recommend instead that you grind for money and starting improving your gears.</b></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>If you got here then it means you have evolved to a Dragon Knight, congratulations&#160;! You'll now be able to access the new stats system called traits, if you forgot how they work I recommend to check back the beginning of the guide in the Stats section. The traits will give you a nice power spike thanks to the impact of the POW stat both for its scaling in some 4th class skills and also mostly because of the P.ATK it gives. <b>At this moment if you are still very poorly geared, you'll be facing a wall unless you get carried by EXP teams (which probably is the same thing that might have been happening on the previous levels too). In this case it is time that you give leveling a rest and focus on getting some basic gears (it could be at least a +9 Grace set that you can get for basically free <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Academy.html">here</a>, or some overrefined Illusion gears). The important is that you become able to hold your ground by yourself against enemies of content of endgame 3rd class content, so that you can check out easily instances and dungeons by yourself.</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Lv 200+</b>
<ul><li>At this level several possibilities are available; either you can try out the new 4th class maps (Niflheim Dungeon 1 or Rudus 4), either you can stick to some late endgame contents of 3rd classes like the last levels of Thanatos Tower which still give a good amount of EXP. If you die too much, you may want to join some leveling teams like the many Thanatos Tower 12 parties. After a dozen levels earnt on your character, you'll want to dump it all on the POW stat to get a big damage boost, whatever build you are currently running.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 215+</b>
<ul><li>On level 215 opens a singular new map which is Amiticia Dungeon; the density of monsters is not as good as Niflheim Dungeon or Thanatos Tower, but the monsters give correct EXP. Thus swapping to this map is not obligatory but it's available.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 230+</b>
<ul><li>After level 230 a dive in the earnt EXP will be noticed, it slows down pretty hard and it is usually recommended to run on Field Manuals at this point. It is an alright level to stop at if the grind gets too difficult for you, as you have access at this level to a maxed trait, which in our case should be POW at 100 for maximum damage boost. This and the potentially good new damage skills which can replace or complement your current main skill. If you want to keep on grinding though, you will want to head to the level 2 of Amiticia Dungeon.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Lv 240+</b>
<ul><li>At 240 the exp requirement skyrockets once again, but if you are ready to keep going until the end you may want to swap to the second floor of the Niflheim dungeon.</li></ul></li>
