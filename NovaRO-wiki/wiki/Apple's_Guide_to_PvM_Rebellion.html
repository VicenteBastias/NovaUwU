<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction_to_the_Rebel">Introduction to the Rebel</span></h2>
<p>The Rebel, or as the game calls them, Rebellion, is a class that specializes in long-range attacks using a variety of Firearms at their disposal.
</p><p>As part of the extended classes, the Rebel does not boast high amounts of HP and SP (although HP and SP and a variety of other aspects of the Rebel was increased with the Rebel's Awakening update) like the 3rd classes. This, however, does not mean that Rebels aren't able to hold their weight in fights.
</p><p>The skills modifiers on all of Rebel's skills are arguably some of the highest in the game (with some reaching almost 10,000% with the right weapons and ammunition), making Rebel one of the more effective damage dealers in the game. For players who had played Gunslingers before, they would be very delighted to know that each weapon will receive new skills under the Rebel's skill tree, with each of them allowing Rebels to be more effective in dealing with all sorts of enemies!
</p><p>For this particular guide, I'll mainly talk about the PvM aspect for Rebels as I'm not too familiar in the PvP aspect for the game. Also, this guide assumes that the player has a basic understanding of the other classes in Ragnarok Online and follows the most recent data from kRO which is implemented in NovaRO. Information here may not necessarily be the same as on other servers!
</p><p>Without further ado, let's begin!

<h2><span id="Rebel.27s_Arsenal_of_Weapons"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebel's_Arsenal_of_Weapons">Rebel's Arsenal of Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Firearms are the Rebel's (or Gunslingers, if you will!) choice of weapons and each of them are very different from each other. These weapons are: <b>Pistols, Gatlings, Rifles, Shotgun and Grenade Launcher</b>. I'll be explaining the advantages and disadvantages for each weapon so that you players can make an informed decision about which weapons you would like to use!
</p><p>Don't worry, skills of Gunslingers and Rebels will be covered in another section!
</p><p>Below is a comparison list for the weapon-types that a Rebel would use:

<p>Pistols are the signature weapon of Rebels and there's definitely good reasons why they are!
</p><p>Boasting the highest base ASPD of all the Firearms, it's really one of the weapons for a Rebel to easily reach 193 (max) ASPD and it comes with the ability to Double-Attack (as long as you've learned <b>Chain Action</b>), while other weapons requires the Rebel skill, <b>Eternal Chain</b> to be learned. More information regarding this <b>Eternal Chain</b> skill will be explained later.
</p><p>The downside of this particular Firearm is that the Pistol generally has the lowest ATK out of all of the Firearms, although the attack speed you get out of this weapon will be more than enough to make up for it!

<p>The Gatling Gun is primary choice of weapon for any Rebels who wants to focus on Attack Speed, as the Gatling Gun has a decent base ASPD, as well as a higher base ATK; both of which can be further increased through the skill <b>Gatling Fever, </b>making this<b> </b>the big brother version of the Pistol.
</p><p>The Gatling Gun, however, loses the ability to proc <b>Chain Action</b> instead. This, however, could be solved through the skill <b>Eternal Chain</b> which gives Gatling Guns the ability to proc <b>Chain Action</b>, making this firearm the primary choice of weapon for any Rebels intending to defeat their enemies through sheer speed.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Rifles are considered one of the specialty firearms that a Rebel can use. Boasting higher base ATK than Gatling Guns, a Rifle can potentially do massive amount of damage (up to 9600% damage) through the skill <b>Hammer of God</b> at max level. Despite this, Rifles are rarely seen in the PvM environment due to the niche role it fulfills. The majority of Rifle's skills involves very calculated usage (much like itself!) of its skills as each most skills have a cast-time or huge after-delay of sorts.
</p><p>Despite the lower base ASPD of the Rifle, it's entirely possible for a Rebel player to each 193 ASPD with the Rifle with the aid of several ASPD items. As most Rifle would give CRITs by itself, it's generally advisable for Rebels who choose Rifles to be specialized in CRITs for PvM!
</p><p>The Rifle is also one of better weapons for PvP. Like previously mentioned, the Rifle has one of the highest damage modifiers for a skill in the game, hence it's entirely possible for Rebel players to decimate other players through sheer damage. However, since I'm not too much of a PvP person, I can't comment too much on this!

<p>If you're looking for big numbers for your damage, this is the firearm to pick up! By using the skill <b>Slug Shot</b>, a Rebel can easily destroy lower-tier MvPs in a single skill, thanks to the skill's massive damage modifier. It's entirely possible for a Rebel to hit more than 10,000% ATK using that skill!
</p><p>Despite having big numbers, the Shotgun's weakness is the low base ASPD it has (you will have gear for ASPD almost exclusively to reach 193 ASPD) as well as the HIT penalties it suffers at longer ranges (specifically for <b>Slug Shot</b>). Not only that, <b>Slug Shot</b> has a long fixed and variable cast-time which makes it nearly impossible (other than in certain situations) to pull off quickly.
</p><p>Still, Shotgun is still one of the preferred weapon in PvP, although like previously mentioned, I can't comment too much on the aspects of PvP!

<p>The last firearm to be introduced is the Grenade Launcher. While the Grenade Launcher has the highest ATK of all firearms, it also has the lowest base ASPD of all firearms. In fact, it's so low that it's most likely impossible to reach 193 ASPD on this weapon.
</p><p>Still, the Grenade Launcher has its uses. The skill <b>Dragon Tail</b> that is exclusive to the Grenade Launcher has 9000% ATK modifier and does not need to be "aimed" once a target has been marked by a <b>Crimson Marker</b>. The Grenade Launcher will perform fairly on both PvM and PvP aspects thanks to its huge ATK modifier, but because of its unwieldy nature, a Grenade Launcher is best relegated as a secondary weapon instead.

<p>With so many categories of Firearms to choose from, it's definitely troublesome to settle down on a weapon for usage.
</p><p>As a way to guide new Rebel players, I'll separate the categories of weapons into 2 groups: Primary and Secondary Firearms.
</p><p>What are the difference between this Primary and Secondary weapons?
</p><p>Primary firearms are weapons that you'll find yourself using regularly for almost every scenario of your setting and it's very important for you to prioritize (in terms of upgrading, carding or even mastering) these firearms. Secondary firearms are weapons that will generally see less usage and instead will be used to increase your damage to the enemy during skill cooldowns, or simply applying a debuff to enemy. How each Secondary Firearms (if applicable) will be used in each of the build will be covered in the builds section.
</p><p>Generally speaking, a PvM Rebel will most likely find themselves using <b>Pistols</b> and <b>Gatling Guns</b> most of the time, while the PvP Rebel will find more uses in <b>Shotguns</b> and <b>Rifles</b>.

<p>That said, the above combinations are just suggestions as a Shotgun is still a possible weapon for PvM due to the high damage modifier it brings to the fight. Likewise, a Pistol will still be a possible weapon in PvP as <b>Desperado</b> is still a force to be reckoned with, assuming certain conditions are met! (conditions will be elaborated later!)

<p>All of a Rebel's skills are segregated into their respective firearm branch, so it's important for a Rebel player to know what each skill does in the game. However, before we venture into a Rebel's skills, I would like to introduce Rebel players to the 1st class, Gunslinger's skills.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gunslinger_Skills">Gunslinger Skills</span></h3>
<p>Like the Rebel, a Gunslinger's skill tree is also segregated into different branches, each respective to the firearm that they work with.
</p><p>While a good majority of Gunslinger's skills (especially the weapon skills) will be replaced by Rebel's weapon skills, it's important for Rebels to know what each skills in the Gunslinger tree can offer them.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Passive_Skills">Passive Skills</span></h4>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_Active_Skills">Common Active Skills</span></h4>
<p>While a majority of a Gunslinger's skills are separated into their firearm's branch, there are a few skills that is shared between all of the firearms. A good majority of these common active skills requires the usage of <i>Coins</i>, a resource that is unique to the Gunslinger and Rebel classes, so having a constant supply of coins is one of the things that a Gunslinger or Rebel must be aware of!
</p><p><i>Coins </i>are obtainable through the usage of <b>Coin Flip</b>.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="File_Coins_.html" class="image"><img alt="" src="../w/images/e/eb/Coins_.png" decoding="async" width="300" height="128" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Coins_.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>How to determine how many coins you have as a Gunslinger and Rebel!</div></div></div>
<p>Each coin that the player currently possesses is indicated as a white (Gunslinger) / blue (Rebel) orb that is hovering around the player. A smaller orb represents 1 coin, while a bigger orb represents 2 coins. The maximum amount of coins a Gunslinger or Rebel can hold at once are 10 coins. It's worth to note that each coin gives 3 ATK, so you can have a maximum of 30 ATK as long as you keep all 10 coins up! Therefore, it's definitely a good habit for any Gunslingers or Rebels to replenish their consumed coins as soon as possible!

</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_Active_Skills_2">Common Active Skills</span></h4>
<p>Like its Gunslinger counterpart, most of these active skills requires the use of coins for activation. Some of these skills will consume as many as 10 coins and will have different level of effects depending on the coins consumed.

This buff will expire once the shield has been depleted, when the skill has reached the end of its duration or when the player switches to another ammunition that is not Holy-element. An interesting thing about this skill is that the ATK buff is tied to the amount of coins consumed, so the more coins you have when you use this skill, the more ATK will be granted! This skill also requires Holy-element bullets to be equipped and has duration of 90 seconds at max level with no cooldown, making it the primary skill for Rebels to improve their survivability and damage. <b>Platinum Alter </b>does not stack with <b>Heat Barrel</b>. If you cast <b>Platinum Alter</b> while <b>Heat Barrel</b> is active, you will not receive the buff from <b>Platinum</b> <b>Alter.</b></li>
<li><a href="File_Heat_barrel.html" class="image"><img alt="Heat barrel.png" src="../w/images/5/5f/Heat_barrel.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Heat Barrel:</b> Consumes all coins to give a buff that increases your ATK up to 200%, gives up to 5 flat ASPD with a penalty of up to 50 HIT at max level. This skill, like <b>Platinum Alter</b>, will grant you bonus ATK based on the amount of coins consumed. This skill has a duration of 60 seconds at max level and has a cooldown of (100 at Lv1 ~80 at max level) seconds, which means you can't keep <b>Heat Barrel </b>up continuously, making it a skill that you should only use when facing off bosses! <b>Heat Barrel</b> does not stack with <b>Platinum Alter</b>! <b><u>WARNING: Do not switch equipments if you have Heat Barrel active. By doing so, you'll put Heat Barrel on a cooldown and not receive the Heat Barrel buff!

Since there's no cooldown to this skill and <b>Chain Action</b> actually procs pretty often (50% chance), a Rebel will be able to spam this skill quite frequently for extra damage. As <b>Chain Action</b> only procs with Pistol, the buff that <b>Eternal Chain </b>provides mean that all firearms could proc <b>Chain Action</b>, effectively allowing <b>Quick Draw Shot</b> to be used with any firearms.<b> Quick Draw Shot</b> will also damage ALL enemies marked by <b>Crimson Marker</b> in a 21x21 AoE, allowing a Rebel to tackle as many as 3 marked monsters at once with this skill.</li></ul>

If the targeted location is unreachable, this skill will fail.</li>
<li><a href="File_Firedance.html" class="image"><img alt="Firedance.png" src="../w/images/9/99/Firedance.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Fire Dance:</b> Fire Dance is very similar to <b>Desperado</b>, except it does a single hit with a bigger 5x5 PBAoE (AoE that centers around the player) at a 1000% ATK. Despite that, <b>Desperado</b>'s damage potential is still higher than Fire Dance as 2 hits of <b>Desperado </b>(<i>a <b>Desperado</b> would have an average of 2-3 hits</i>) would have already out-damage a single <b>Fire Dance</b>. However, because of how fragile Rebels are in combat, it's usually not recommended that Rebels try to <b>Fire Dance </b>or <b>Desperado</b> through the enemies!</li></ul>

<ul><li><a href="File_Firerain.html" class="image"><img alt="Firerain.png" src="../w/images/b/b9/Firerain.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Fire Rain: </b>Fire Rain has an interesting AoE: a 3x10 AoE in front of the Rebel that does up to 5000% ATK with a chance of removing ground based skills. Despite the high damage it offers, Fire Rain is a very unwieldy skill because of its rectangular-shaped AoE.</li>
<li><a href="File_Roundtrip.html" class="image"><img alt="Roundtrip.png" src="../w/images/4/45/Roundtrip.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Round Trip:</b> Round Trip is definitely one of Rebel's signature Gatling skill. Boasting up to a massive 13x13 PBAoE (AoE that centers around the player) at max level, Round Trip is able to do up to 2500% ATK, pushing back the enemies as well as potentially damaging the enemy further if they hit a wall. Definitely a skill you would want to keep yourself safe as well as damaging enemies!</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Rifle_Skills_2">Rifle Skills</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Mass_spiral.html" class="image"><img alt="Mass spiral.png" src="../w/images/a/ae/Mass_spiral.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Mass Spiral: </b>Mass Spiral uses a special ammunition called Full Metal Jacket and it allows the Rebel to additional damage based on the DEF of the enemy.</li>
<li><a href="File_Amb.html" class="image"><img alt="Amb.png" src="../w/images/1/1e/Amb.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Anti-Material Blast:</b> Anti-Material Blast or AMB, is definitely one of the better Rifle skills a Rebel could use. Each cast has a 70% chance of inflicting a -50% demi-human resistance on the enemy, which essentially mean doing 50% more damage on the monster from all kinds of player attacks (imagine the amount of damage your party could do!).</li>
<li><a href="File_Hammerofgod.html" class="image"><img alt="Hammerofgod.png" src="../w/images/6/64/Hammerofgod.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Hammer of God:</b> The ultimate Rifle skill that a Rebel has in the Rifle branch. Inflicting up to a massive 9600% ATK on an enemy, this skill has a lengthy skill cool-down upon usage, although most enemies (in a PvP setting) will most like be dead or trying to recover that huge chunk of health removed from them. Because of this lengthy skill cool-down (30 seconds), this skill is rarely used out of PvP as boss enemies in a PvM setting tend to have tens of millions of HP which this skill can't simply remove in a single cast. If <b>Hammer of God was</b> used on an enemy that is not marked by <b>Crimson Marker</b>, the damage inflicted will be lessen. This skill is <i>forced neutral, meaning the element of your equipped ammunition doesn't carry over into the skill.</i></li></ul>

With a small cast time, this skill can inflict up to 2700% ATK in a 7x7 AoE.</li>
<li><a href="File_Banishingbuster.html" class="image"><img alt="Banishingbuster.png" src="../w/images/5/57/Banishingbuster.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Banishing Buster:</b> With a small cast time, this skill is capable of inflicting up to 3500% ATK and up to 100% chance to remove all buffs from enemies at max level, if it hits. This is incredibly useful in a PvP scenario where most players will have buffs that aids them in defeating other players.This might be useful in a PvM setting, but it's definitely more relevant to PvP where you would like to remove buffs from your enemies.</li>
<li><a href="File_Slugshot.html" class="image"><img alt="Slugshot.png" src="../w/images/c/cf/Slugshot.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Slug Shot:</b> The ultimate Shotgun skill that a Rebel has in the Shotgun branch. This skill can do up to 6000% ATK on monsters in PvM and up to 10000% ATK on players in PvP. Not only that, the damage of the skill is further increased by the weight of Slug Rounds that is being used. In NovaRO, there's only 1 kind of Slug Round (<i>Slug Shot XH, which weights an incredible 120 weight per piece</i>) being sold at the Bullets Vendor, so you can be sure that your Slug Shot is doing the highest damage possible in all scenario. The downside of this skill is that you'll gradually lose HIT when you're further away from the enemy you're trying to attack. This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds and is <i>forced neutral, meaning the element of your equipped ammunition doesn't carry over into the skill.</i></li></ul>

Once stuck on an enemy, the Rebel could use <b>Flicker</b> in order to detonate the Mine, dealing additional damage, up to a total of 3200% ATK. While the damage is pretty impressive, <b>Howling Mine</b> is definitely a tedious skill to use as compared to some of the other skills available to a Rebel. This skill requires the use of a Projection Landmine item.</li>
<li><a href="File_Dragontail.html" class="image"><img alt="Dragontail.png" src="../w/images/1/14/Dragontail.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Dragon Tail:</b> Dragon Tail requires the use of a Dragon Tail Missile item and a Marked Target through the use of <b>Crimson Marker</b>. When activated, the Marked targets will be unmarked and the skill will do a massive 9000% ATK, split evenly between all enemies that are marked. With such a high damage modifier, this skill certainly has its uses in both PvM and PvP settings!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebel_Stats_and_Builds">Rebel Stats and Builds</span></h2>
<p>Now that you've been introduced to the skills that a Gunslinger and Rebel has, it's finally the time to introduce the essential stats and builds that a Rebel will most likely follow!
</p><p>All builds will assume that the player has reached the max base level of 175 and max job level of 60, which means the player has 69 Gunslinger skill points 59 Rebel skill points.
</p><p>Note that the stats and skill builds mentioned below are merely suggestions and that you may want to customize these build suggestions to you liking, especially since you're more than likely to know what kind of experience you would like for yourself than me!
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_Points_Allocation">Stats Points Allocation</span></h3>
<p>Like all of the other classes in the game, the Rebel has STR, AGI, VIT, INT, DEX and LUK to work with. Depending on the build you're interested in, the allocation of stats can greatly differ from each other. In general, these are the pointers for each stats point:
</p><p><b>STR: </b>While majority of the damage does not come from STR as a Rebel, some points in STR will allow you carry more ammunition (especially if you're a shotgun user for PvP, those Slug rounds gets incredibly heavy!) and with the added bonus of getting <i>some</i> ATK out of the STR you've invested. LUK is more efficient in raising your ATK, however.
</p><p><b>AGI:</b> AGI is really important for classes that focuses on using auto attacks on enemies. Without AGI, it's hard to imagine how a Rebel would reach max ASPD. Definitely a stat you would want to invest in, as long as your focus is auto attacking!
</p><p><b>VIT: </b>While most ranged players would forgo VIT as part of their build, VIT is a highly valued stat to me. With more HP means a Rebel could take more hits before dying and more HP works very well with <b>Platinum Alter</b>!
</p><p><b>INT</b>: Since the Rebel's SP pool isn't exactly the biggest you'll ever see, some investment of points into INT is probably recommended. There are certainly uses for more INT, since <b>Magical Bullet </b>works well with increased MATK, although this is a really niche build.
</p><p><b>DEX: </b>The most important stat for any ranged characters. DEX is the number one stat that you would want to invest in, as it not only gives you higher accuracy, more damage, it also gives you some ASPD. While the increase is not as significant as AGI in terms of ASPD, it's still a welcomed bonus as a ranged character would need high amounts of DEX no matter what!
</p><p><b>LUK:</b> This stat is for those who focuses on CRIT builds. Not only that, it gives you a small increase of ATK, so it might be a better investment than STR for some people.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Auto_Attack_Build">Auto Attack Build</span></h2>
<p>This build focuses on attacking your enemies at the highest ASPD possible while using <b>Chain Action</b> and <b>Quick Draw Shot</b> to deal extra damage as you attack them.
</p><p>While this particular build does not have the flashy damage as the other builds that I'll be mentioning later, this build does have the advantage of having a decent continuous damage throughout the fight without any downtime. If you're that kind of player (like me!) who likes to click on monsters and don't think too much into it, this is definitely the build for you!
</p><p>A Rebel could choose either a pair of <b>Pistols or a Gatling Gun as their Primary Weapon</b> for this particular build, although a Gatling Gun will definitely be preferred choice as the Rebel improves their equipment. The Rebel could choose between <b>Shotgun, Rifle or Grenade Launcher for their Secondary Weapon</b>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Important_Skills">Important Skills</span></h3>
<p>As this particular build will revolve around Pistols and Gatling Guns, we'll be picking up skills from the Pistols and Gatling Guns branch as primary choice of firearms for both Gunslinger and Rebel. I'll also denote the skill level required for each skill, a short explanation of each skill as well as the secondary choice of firearms for this particular build.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_Build">Critical Build</span></h2>
<p>This build shares many similarities with the Auto-attacking build, except it places focus on CRITs instead of using <b>Quick Draw Shot</b> to defeat enemies.
</p><p>By utilizing CRITs, a CRIT orientated Rebel will be able to put out some very impressive damage, since CRITs deals maximum amount of damage possible in a single attack. However, due to CRITs being overwritten by Double-Attack, you would want to avoid Chain Action at all costs, so not using a Pistol is recommended.
</p><p><b>NOTE</b>: While it's certainly possible to reach 193 ASPD with a Rifle, you'll most likely need to equip quite a bit of ASPD gears, as well as using several AGI food. <b>Heat Barrel</b> is an extremely useful skill for Rifles to reach 193 ASPD.
</p><p>A CRIT orientated Rebel will use <b>Gatling Guns and Rifles</b> almost exclusively, as CRIT orientated Rebels will not use any weapon skills (such as <b>Slug Shot</b> or even <b>Desperado</b>) as these skills lack the ability to CRIT. Hence, as a CRIT Rebel, both the Gatling Guns and Rifles will be your primary and secondary weapons. A CRIT Rebel can also pick up a pair of <b>Pistols</b> for taking advantage of <b>Desperado</b>, but it's not a requirement.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Important_Skills_2">Important Skills</span></h3>
<p>As this particular build will revolve around Gatling Guns and Rifles, we'll be picking up skills from the Gatling Guns and Rifles branch for both Gunslinger and Rebel. I'll also denote the skill level required for each skill, as well as a short explanation of each skill.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gunslinger_2">Gunslinger</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Singleaction.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Singleaction.png" src="../w/images/e/e1/Singleaction.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Single Action</b> <b>(Lv10 / 10): </b>Having that 2 extra HIT between Lv9 and Lv10 might make a difference for some monsters!</li>
<li><a href="File_Chainaction.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Chainaction.png" src="../w/images/0/02/Chainaction.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Chain Action (Lv3 (or 10) / 10): </b>Although Chain Action interferes with CRITs, as long as you do not use Eternal Chain or use a pair of Pistols, Chain Action will never proc. As the CRIT build only utilizes 2 weapons, there will be more skill points leftover in the Gunslinger skill tree than you'll know what to do with, so adding skill points into Chain Action to Lv10 will enable you to use Pistols. If not, you can always leave this at Lv3 instead.</li>
<li><a href="File_Snakeeye.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Snakeeye.png" src="../w/images/7/75/Snakeeye.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Snake's Eye (Lv10 / 10): </b>Maxing Snake's Eye will allow you to attack at the maximum range possible.

Rapid Shower is also a requirement for Gatling Fever.</li>
<li><a href="File_Desperado.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Desperado.png" src="../w/images/5/57/Desperado.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Desperado (Lv5 (or 10) / 10): </b>While Gatling Fever only requires 5 levels of Desperado to be unlocked, Desperado is an amazing source of damage that should not be underestimated. Chances are that you'll have more skill points than you'll know what to do with the CRIT build, so investing 5 more skill points in Desperado is a very valid option.</li>
<li><a href="File_Gatlingfever.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Gatlingfever.png" src="../w/images/4/43/Gatlingfever.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Gatling Fever (Lv10 / 10): </b>As the Gatling Gun is 1 of the 2 primary firearms you'll use in this build, there's really no reason to say no to free damage from Gatling Fever.</li>
<li><a href="File_Tracking.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Tracking.png" src="../w/images/5/5f/Tracking.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Tracking (Lv5 / 10): </b>While Tracking is not a very impressive skill by itself, Tracking is required for unlocking the Rebel's Rifle skill branch.</li>
<li><a href="File_Piercingshot.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Piercingshot.png" src="../w/images/e/e5/Piercingshot.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Piercing Shot (Lv1 / 10): </b>Piercing Shot is also required for unlocking the Rebel's Rifle skill branch.</li></ul>
<p>If you choose not to add skill points into Chain Action or Desperado, you should have a couple of spare skill points lying around. As previously mentioned, a CRIT Rebel will rarely find themselves in situations where they would have to cast a damage dealing skill, so it's really up to your imagination on how you want to branch off from here!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Slug_Shot_Build">Slug Shot Build</span></h2>
<p>The <b>Slug Shot</b> build is an extremely simple build that follows a very simple philosophy: dealing the maximum possible damage in a single skill-cast. Just a note that this particular build is entirely considered a "for-fun" build in the PvM setting as it's very unfeasible for a <b>Slug Shot</b> build to go around with parties to Instances and higher tier MvPs as it takes too long for <b>Slug Shot</b> to cast to be effective as compared to CRIT or auto-attack builds.
</p><p>Due to the massive ATK modifier that is possible with Slug Shot, it's entirely possible to defeat lower tier MVPs (Moonlight Flower, Golden Thief Bug, etc...) in a single <b>Slug Shot</b> cast. In fact, with the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13214/slug-shot-xh">XH Slug Ammunition</a>, the damage modifier could easily reach 10,000% or even more. However, because of the huge fixed casting time on this skill, it makes the skill extremely unwieldy in most situations.
</p><p>The weapon of choice for a <b>Slug Shot</b> build would be a <a href="File_Deathfireicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Deathfireicon.png" src="../w/images/c/ca/Deathfireicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13192/death-fire-1">Death Fire [1]</a>. With a huge 400 base ATK, the Death Fire has the highest damage among all of the Shotguns in the game, making it an ideal candidate to use <b>Slug Shot</b> with. However, the Death Fire suffers from -50HIT penalty. Adding on top of the Slug Shot's HIT penalty, a Rebel might just find themselves missing a lot on certain monsters that has high enough flee.
</p><p>A <b>Slug Shot</b> Build would probably be more PvP orientated than PvM, although it's still fun to see some really big numbers flying out from a monster!

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_Allocation_3">Stats Allocation</span></h3>
<p>The stats allocation table for Slug Shot is really arbitrary as I personally only played with Slug Shot a couple of times. The idea of a Slug Shot Rebel is to defeat their enemies in a single skill-cast, hence damage takes priority over durability. You should also aim to reduce your variable cast time as much as possible.

<ul><li>Heaven's Feather and Hell's Fire is a Lv100 Rebellion pistol that is an good alternative (well, the only alternative actually!) to the Altea &amp; Ares before Lv140. It has 150 ATK and increases Desperado's and Fire Dance's damage by 20% plus a slot with it. However, you'll soon be replacing this with Altea &amp; Ares as the latter is definitely the best pistol you can get.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>Unless you have a highly refined Crimson Revolver, Altea &amp; Ares is arguably the best pistol you can get in the game as a Rebel. With 200 ATK, an additional 30% Ranged Attack bonus on it and the ability to buy this in unlimited qualities (as long as your zenies holds up!), the only downside of this pistol is that it comes with no slot and loses in potential to a Crimson Revolver.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Crimson_revolver.html" class="image"><img alt="Crimson revolver.png" src="../w/images/0/0e/Crimson_revolver.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13127/crimson-revolver-2">Crimson Revolver [2]</a>
<ul><li>Since the update of Crimson weapons in NovaRO, Crimson Revolvers are undoubtedly the best pistols you can get as a Rebel. Boasting 2 amazing effects (one that +5 ATK per 10 Base Level, two being additional damage based on your refine rate) on top of 2 slots, a highly refined (+15 onwards and properly carded) Crimson Revolver has the potential to even out damage a highly refined (+15 onwards) Tempest. Crimson Revolvers can be found as a drop from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1613/metaling">Metaling</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1628/holden">Holden</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gatling_Guns_2">Gatling Guns</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Minimei.html" class="image"><img alt="Minimei.png" src="../w/images/6/6e/Minimei.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13197/minigun-2">Mini Mei [2]</a>
<ul><li>The Mini Mei is the first Rebel Gatling Gun. Boasting 220 ATK and 2 slots, the only downside of the Mini Mei compared to the Tempest is that the Mini Mei is a Lv2 weapon. Nevertheless, the Mini Mei is a very reasonable starting Gatling Gun for any Rebel.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Tempesticon.html" class="image"><img alt="Tempesticon.png" src="../w/images/1/11/Tempesticon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13198/tempest">Tempest</a>
<ul><li>The Tempest comes with 250 ATK, +10 CRIT, 20% Ranged Attack bonus as well as a penalty of -25 HIT. Although the Tempest has no slots, it is a Lv4 weapon, which means at higher refinement, this weapon gives a lot more ATK than a Mini Mei would of similar refine levels. This is the best Gatling Gun for Auto-Attack and CRIT builds.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Rifles_2">Rifles</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Rag203.html" class="image"><img alt="Rag203.gif" src="../w/images/8/82/Rag203.gif" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13190/r-a-g-203-1">RAG203 [1]</a>
<ul><li>The RAG203 has 260 ATK, +10 HIT, +15 CRIT, 1 slot and the ability to cast Lv1 Decrease Agility on an enemy while attacking. While this sounds like a good Rifle to use, the Color Scope has more potential than the RAG203.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Colorscopeicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Colorscopeicon.png" src="../w/images/7/7f/Colorscopeicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13189/color-scope-2">Color Scope [2]</a>
<ul><li>The Color Scope has 240 ATK, +20 HIT, +30 CRIT and 2 slots. What makes this Rifle better than RAG203 is the extra slot it has. With an additional card slot, the Color Scope is more versatile and has more damage potential than the RAG203. This is recommended for CRIT builds.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Shotguns_2">Shotguns</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Rollingthunder.html" class="image"><img alt="Rollingthunder.png" src="../w/images/f/f7/Rollingthunder.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13193/rolling-thunder-1">Rolling Thunder [1]</a>
<ul><li>The Rolling Thunder has a decent 260 ATK, -10 HIT, -10% ASPD and the ability to cast Lv5 Thunderstorm on the enemy while attacking. The Rolling Thunder is a poor Shotgun as Thunderstorm would be next to useless due to Rebel's low INT and it's hard to proc it, considering the slow attack speed of a Shotgun.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Peacekeeper.html" class="image"><img alt="Peacekeeper.png" src="../w/images/6/64/Peacekeeper.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13194/peace-breaker">Peace Breaker</a>
<ul><li>The Peace Breaker has 250 ATK, -25 HIT and 25% increase of ASPD. While the increase of ASPD might sound good, the base ASPD of a Shotgun is pretty low, making the advantage of a Peace Breaker moot.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Deathfireicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Deathfireicon.png" src="../w/images/c/ca/Deathfireicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13192/death-fire-1">Death Fire [1]</a>
<ul><li>The Death Fire has an amazing 400 ATK although it comes with a massive -50 HIT and -10% ASPD penalty. This Shotgun, however, with its massive ATK is the ideal candidate for any Rebel who uses the skill <b>Slug Shot</b> as the ATK modifier on the skill is better multiplied with a high ATK Shotgun. This is highly recommended for <b>Slug Shot</b> builds.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Grenade_Launcher">Grenade Launcher</span></h4>

<ul><li>The End of the Horizon is the first Rebel Grenade Launcher and comes with an impressive 410 ATK, making it ideal for any Rebels below Lv140 who wants to use a Grenade Launcher.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Southerncross.html" class="image"><img alt="Southerncross.png" src="../w/images/b/bf/Southerncross.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/28201/southern-cross">Southern Cross</a>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cards">Cards</span></h4>
<p>Although there's a huge amount of cards that could be compounded on a weapon, only some are of interest to a Rebel. I'll be separating the list of cards into their respective groups.
</p><p><b><u>Damage:</u></b>
</p>
<ul><li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4281/zipper-bear-card">Zipper Bear Card</a>
<ul><li>This card is great for weapons, providing 30 ATK, although you lose 1SP per attack you do. If you're not too worried about your SP, this is a very good way of increasing your damage.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4043/andre-card">Andre Card</a>
<ul><li>This card is decent for increasing your ATK on weapons, providing 20 ATK with no other side effects.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4094/archer-skeleton-card">Archer Skeleton Card</a>
<ul><li>This card is great for ranged damage classes such as Gunslingers and Rebel, boosting Ranged damage by 10%.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4608/white-knightage-card">White Knightage Card</a>
<ul><li>This card is great for weapons regardless of which build you're going. Giving 15 ATK and 20% increase of damage to Medium and Large sized monsters, this is a card that you definitely would want to use no matter the situation. This, however, is an extremely expensive card.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b><u>CRIT:</u></b>
</p>
<ul><li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4421/drosera-card">Drosera Card</a>
<ul><li>This card is great for increasing your CRIT rate and with Color Scope's 2 weapon slots, you can easily reach 100 CRIT.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4521/sedora-card">Sedora Card</a>
<ul><li>This card increases your CRIT damage by 15%, essentially giving you 15% more damage on CRIT builds.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Headgears">Headgears</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Upper_Headgears">Upper Headgears</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Airship.html" class="image"><img alt="Airship.png" src="../w/images/8/89/Airship.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/5359/airship-captains-hat-1">Ship Captain Hat [1]</a>
<ul><li>An additional 7% Ranged Attack bonus is probably one of the best headgears a Rebel can equip. This is only obtainable through the in-game cash shop.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Rideword.html" class="image"><img alt="Rideword.png" src="../w/images/7/76/Rideword.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/5208/rideword-hat-1">Rideword Hat [1]</a>
<ul><li>This hat gives a small chance of converting damage done into HP (5% chance to convert 8% of damage to HP) and SP (1% chance to convert 4% of damage to SP), giving you some limited form of HP/SP leeching while leveling. This hat is obtainable through a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Custom_Headgear_Quests.html#Headgears">Rideword NPC</a> that exists on Clock Tower F1.</li></ul></li>
<li>Fox Ear Ribbons [1]
<ul><li>This headgear provides 10% ASPD as well as a transformation that gives 100% CRIT and varying %Ranged Attack (starting at 5% and increased by 1% per refine past +6). This is one of the best headgears for a CRIT build as it has everything a CRIT Rebel wants. This item is only obtainable through the in-game cash shop.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Headgears">Middle Headgears</span></h4>
<ul><li><a href="File_Sigrun.html" class="image"><img alt="Sigrun.png" src="../w/images/6/65/Sigrun.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/5592/sigruns-wings">Sigrun's Wings</a>
<ul><li>2% Ranged Attack bonus is better than 2% ATK increase from Robo Eyes because of how formulas are calculated, but you lose out on the DEX. I would recommend Sigrun's Wings over Robo Eyes though! This is only obtainable through the in-game cash shop.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Robo.html" class="image"><img alt="Robo.png" src="../w/images/f/ff/Robo.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/5325/robo-eye">Robo Eyes</a>

<ul><li>One of the cheapest ways for any players to get a slotted middle headgear.

<li>Slotted Middle Headgear
<ul><li>If you don't want to use a Monocle, it's possible to get other slotted middle headgears. Spiritual Auger, an item from the in-game cash shop, will allow you to slot a wide variety of middle headgear.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cards_2">Cards</span></h4>
<p>Like weapons, there's a huge variety of cards that can be slotted into both Upper and Middle headgears. Below is a list of suggested cards for headgears, as well as the purpose mentioned.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4468/dark-pinguicula-card">Dark Pinguicula Card</a>
<ul><li>This card provides 10 ATK when compounded to a headgear. If you're looking to increase your ATK, this is one of the cards you'll want to look for!</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4411/vanberk-card">Vanberk Card</a>
<ul><li>Vanberk Card provides 1 STR and a chance of gaining 100 CRIT for 5 seconds while attacking an enemy, making it an extremely good card for CRIT build. This card is a good alternative to Fox Ear Ribbons [1].</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Fortunity_-_EoE_Str.html" class="image"><img alt="Fortunity - EoE Str.gif" src="../w/images/2/25/Fortunity_-_EoE_Str.gif" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4910/darklord-essence-force3">Essence of Evil STR3 (EoE STR3)</a>
<ul><li>This "card" is unique as it can be compounded to any equipment and the headgear is no exception to this. EoE STR3 gives 4 STR, +12 ATK and -4 INT. Despite the penalty of 4 INT, since Rebels does not benefit much from INT, this "card" is a better choice over Dark Pinguicula Card for Rebels seeking ATK as it confers 2 additional ATK.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4403/kiel-d-01-card">Kiel D-01 Card (MvP)</a>
<ul><li>If you're lucky enough to receive one of this card, you'll be see a reduction in your after-cast delay. This is an excellent card for Pistol builds that utilizes <b>Desperado</b> or <b>Fire Dance</b> as it'll allow these builds to continously spam the skills.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4458/duneyrr-card">Duneyrr Card</a>
<ul><li>Duneyrr Card provides 10 ATK as well as chance to receive 4 seconds of 10% perfect dodge, making it an alternative to Dark Pinguicula Card for increasing your ATK on a headgear.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b><u>Status Immunity</u></b>
</p><p>Other than combat related, cards compounded on headgears can also provide status immunity.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4122/deviruchi-card">Deviruchi Card</a>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Armor">Armor</span></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, for Rebels, the choices of good armors are extremely limited.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="File_Glittering.html" class="image"><img alt="Glittering.png" src="../w/images/1/1d/Glittering.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/2319/glittering-jacket-1">Glittering Jacket [1]</a>
<ul><li>The reason as to why this particular armor is chosen is because it has the possibility of being enchanted with stats. Getting a +3 DEX or +3 AGI is probably the best enchantment you want for this armor.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Armypadding.html" class="image"><img alt="Armypadding.png" src="../w/images/0/05/Armypadding.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/15024/army-padding">Army Padding</a>
<ul><li>Army Padding is a decent alternative to Glittering Jacket and can be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Mora_Enchants">enchanted through the usage of Mora Coins</a> and has no slots. The effects of enchantment are randomized and comes with a chance of failure, which will completely destroy the armor. On the bright side, possible enchantment includes %ATK, so if you're feeling adventurous, you might want to try it!</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cards_3">Cards</span></h4>
<p>There's a huge variety of cards that could be compounded into armor. Below is a list of suggested cards for armor compounding.
</p><p><b><u>General:</u></b>

<ul><li>Adding 25 ATK at the cost of -5 DEF is a great trade off! Use this card if you're looking to boosting your ATK further.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>If you're looking for more HP, then this is the card to be compounded with your armor.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b><u>Elemental / Status Resistance:</u></b>
</p><p>Other than combat related, there are cards that will change your element, or prevent status effects.
</p>

<ul><li>Changes your armor element to Undead, making you immune to Frozen and Stone Curse status. Downside is that you'll be weaker to Fire and Holy.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="File_Cardicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Cardicon.png" src="../w/images/3/38/Cardicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4119/bathory-card">Bathory Card</a>
<ul><li>Changes your armor element to Shadow. As quite a few bosses uses skills such as Cross of Darkness and Grand Cross of Darkness, having Shadow element armor greatly reduces the amount of damage you take from them.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Garment">Garment</span></h3>
<ul><li><a href="File_Heroic.html" class="image"><img alt="Heroic.png" src="../w/images/8/88/Heroic.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/2576/heroic-backpack-1">Heroic Backpack [1]</a>
<ul><li>The Heroic Backpack (HBP) is one of the best Garments any classes can wear. Once refined to +7/+9 and having 90 points in DEX and AGI, this backpack gives an incredible 5%/10% increase in Ranged damage and 8%ASPD (and +1ASPD with a +9 HBP).

<p>Rebels have one advantage that other classes do not possess: the ability to purchase as much weapons as they require without hunting for them.
</p><p>Sounds great right? Except all of these weapons aren't exactly cheap. But still, convenience comes with a price, as majority of Rebel's weapons costs more than 1 million zenies each!
</p><p>The image on the right shows the NPCs that are of interest to all Rebel players. The Firearm Merchant sells all of Rebel's weapons, while the ammunition merchant sells all sorts of ammunition that a Rebel would use.
</p><p>The Ammunition Merchant, as of recently, has started selling cartridges too! This means you won't need to talk to the Magazine Dealer anymore!

<p>Like Archer's bows, the Rebel's Firearms requires ammunition to work. One interesting thing about the Rebel's arsenal of ammunition is that they are separated into 2 distinct groups, utility and damage. I'll explain the difference between these two groups below!
</p><p>All of the ammunition mentioned in this section are all sold in the Ammunition Merchant, located in Prontera.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Utility_Ammunition">Utility Ammunition</span></h3>
<p>Utility ammunition, like its name suggests, are a group of ammunition that does not require the player to equip in order to use. Generally speaking, all of these ammunition are used for skills and these said skills will fail without these ammunition in your inventory.
</p><p>As a Gunslinger, you'll probably never use any of these utility ammunition as none of Gunslinger skills requires the use of a utility ammunition.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Damage_Ammunition">Damage Ammunition</span></h3>
<p>Damage ammunition, like its name suggests, are a group of ammunition that does damage. Like Archer's bows, a firearm would require a damage ammunition to be equipped in order for it to work. Below is a list of ammunition that a Gunslinger/Rebel would use and be aware that they are separated into two groups because of their level requirements (Gunslinger-tier and Rebel-tier).
</p><p>The only difference between the two groups of ammunition are the amount of damage each ammunition brings. However, once you're a Rebel, you'll generally only use Rebel-tier ammunition.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leveling">Leveling</span></h2>
<p>Leveling a Rebel is not as hard as you may think, with a wide variety of high ATK modifiers skills at your disposal, a Gunslinger/Rebel is more than capable of defeating most enemies before Lv100 with incredible ease.
</p><p>The Eden Group is an invaluable place to gain EXP from the quests they provide. As soon as you're a Gunslinger, remember to sign up as an Eden group member (type @go eden) so you'll have access to the wide variety of quest that they provide on their quest boards.
</p><p>As all of Rebel's weapons are very costly (all of them are at least 1 million zenies each), it's highly recommended that you loot every drop possible from a monster. I <b>highly recommend </b>you to<b> type @autoloot</b> once you start any characters to make sure you loot every single item from defeating an enemy!
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Novice">Novice</span></h3>
<p>As part of the tutorial system that NovaRO provides, it's entirely possible to get to BaseLv8 and JobLv10 without even hitting a single monster. By following the NPCs outlined in Izlude, you'll soon arrive at the tutorial Academy, which will put you to JobLv10 by registering with them.
</p><p>From here on out, you have the choice of going through the tutorials, or simply go to Prontera (type @go 0) to get yourself changed into a Gunslinger. The <a href="Main_Office.html" title="Main Office">Main Office</a> in Prontera handles all of your job changing, so head over there and change into a Gunslinger!
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gunslinger_4">Gunslinger</span></h3>
<p>Congratulations! You're now a Gunslinger! This is just the first step towards being a Rebel.
</p><p>As a Gunslinger, you'll have access to all of the firearm types as mentioned above, but out of all the firearms types available, the Pistols will be your primary weapon for leveling. As you have expected, the skills that you'll use really often during this stage are <b>Rapid Shower</b> and <b>Desperado</b>.
</p><p>However, first things first; some of the skills you should pick up first includes: <b>Single Action</b>, <b>Chain Action</b> and <b>Snake's Eyes</b>. These are very important skills as they allow you to defeat enemies faster with a safe distance.
</p><p>If repetitive hunting is not your kind of thing, you may opt to go to the <a href="Eden_Group.html" title="Eden Group">Eden Group</a> and pick up quests on their quest board respective to your level. These quests are a good source of EXP and most of them are repeatable.
</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to skip through the trouble of leveling, you may want to opt to do the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village">Cautious Village</a> quest, which will bring you to around BaseLv76, JobLv50. Remember, you can only do this quest once! (<i>Credits to Hoop who made me aware of this!</i>)
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lv8_-_40">Lv8 - 40</span></h4>
<p>Payon Dungeon will the primary place for any Gunslingers to level. Once you've added a few skill points into <b>Rapid Shower</b>, chances are that you'll be able to use a single <b>Rapid Shower</b> to defeat almost any enemies you meet. You may want to select different levels of Rapid Shower and place them on your hotkeys to save SP, as increasing levels of Rapid Shower consumes more SP.
</p><p>At this point, your goal is to be able to defeat all, if not most, monsters in 1 or 2 <b>Rapid Showers</b>. The list below indicates monsters of interest, as well as their drops so that you can earn some zenies for your Rebel weapon purchase when you reach Lv100!
</p><p><b>Payon Dungeon Level 1:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Zombie (drops Opal, can be sold for 3000z each to NPC)</li>
<li>Skeleton (drops Skull Ring, can be sold for 5000z each to NPC)</li>
<li>Familiar</li></ul>
<p>All of these monsters are extremely easy to kill with a single <b>Rapid Shower</b>! Both Zombie and Skeletons are Undead, so Silver Bullets will work great against them.
</p><p><b>Payon Dungeon Level 2:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Soldier Skeleton (drops Stilleto, can be sold for 9750z each to NPC)</li>
<li>Archer Skeleton</li></ul>
<p>These two are your primary source of EXP for this level. Like in Level 1, most of these monsters should die in a single <b>Rapid Shower</b>. Both monsters of interest are Undead, so Silver Bullets will work great against them.
</p><p>At <b>Lv26 - 33</b>, you can head over to Eden Group to accept <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html#Instructor_Boya_.28Level_12_-_60.29">Instructor Boya's quests</a> in order to get a better weapon.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lv41_-_70">Lv41 - 70</span></h4>
<p>At <b>Lv50 - 59, </b>you may get another weapon from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html#Instructor_Boya_.28Level_12_-_60.29">Instructor Boya</a> at the Eden Group.
</p><p>As usual, you'll be relying on <b>Rapid Shower</b> for your leveling.
</p><p>Below are some of the places you can go for leveling:
</p><p><b>Toy Factory Level 2:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Mystcase (drops Piece of Cake, can be sold for 1500z each to NPC)</li>
<li>Crusier</li></ul>
<p>While Toy Factory's EXP is not the greatest within this level range, it is one of the best place for any Gunslingers to be earn money. Mystcase drops "Piece of Cake", which can be sold to NPCs for 1,500z. It may not look much, but if you have 100 pieces of this cake, you'll be having 150k zennies! Not bad!
</p><p>As Mystcase and Crusiers have element weaknesses, you'll probably want to use neutral (Bullet or Bloody Bullet) ammunition.
</p><p><b>Orc Dungeon Level 1:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Orc Zombie</li>
<li>Orc Skeleton</li></ul>
<p>Continuing the tradition of defeating Undead monsters, Orc Dungeon is another excellent place for you to earn EXP while using Silver Bullets. This place is excellent for the usage of <b>Desperado</b> as the spawns are reasonably high, so you can grab a gigantic mass of zombies and then defeat them all in a single <b>Desperado</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lv71_-_99">Lv71 - 99</span></h4>
<p>During this level range, you may want to replace your weapon with something better. You can head over to Eden Group to accept <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html#Instructor_Ur_.28Level_60_-_100.29">Instructor Ur's quests</a> in order to get a better weapon.
</p><p>The monsters that are suggested below are part of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html">Eden Group's quest boards</a>. Do remember to visit the quest boards in order to accept the quests and turn them in for decent amount of EXP!
</p><p><b>Glast Heim St. Abbey</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Evil Druid (drops Yggdrasil Leaf, can be sold for 2000z each to NPC)</li>
<li>Wraith (drops Fabric, an item popular with players, type @wb 1059 to find out who buys these items)</li></ul>
<p>St. Abbey is the first place you should go upon reaching Lv70+. Both Wraiths and Evil Druids are incredibly easy to kill with Rapid Shower and they give really decent EXP. Pair this with Eden Group's quest boards of Lv71 - Lv85, you'll get to Lv86+ in no time. Since both monsters of note are Undead, Silver Bullets are recommended.
</p><p><b>Glast Heim Churchyard</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Evil Druid (drops Yggdrasil Leaf, can be sold for 2000z each to NPC)</li>
<li>Wraith (drops Fabric, an item popular with players, type @wb 1059 to find out who buys these items)</li>
<li>Dark Priest</li></ul>
<p>Churchyard can be accessed through the portals in St. Abbey. Both portals on the map will connect to Churchyard. Once you're in Churchyard, you'll be primarily hunting for Dark Priest. Dark Priests might provide a little bit of challenge compared to the rest of the monsters you've fought (Dark Priest usually will take 2-3 <b>Rapid Showers</b> to be defeated), so be prepared! Like Evil Druid and Wraith, Dark Priest is weak to Holy element, so the usage of Silver Bullets are highly recommended.
</p><p>On the flipside, Dark Priest gives some really excellent EXP, so it's well worth the effort.
</p><p>Once you've reached Lv99, you can head back to the Main Office to change into a Rebel. Unlike the other classic classes, there's no need for you to restart from Level 1!
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebellion">Rebellion</span></h3>
<p>Despite being a Rebel, you'll realize that you probably won't use a good majority of your Rebel skills, not until at least you're Lv140. Some of the skills that you'll want to pick up as soon as possible will be:
</p><p><a href="File_Richscoin.html" class="image"><img alt="Richscoin.png" src="../w/images/f/f2/Richscoin.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Rich's Coin</b>
</p><p><a href="File_Platinum_altar.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Platinum altar.png" src="../w/images/d/d1/Platinum_altar.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Platinum Alter</b>
</p><p><a href="File_Heat_barrel.html" class="image"><img alt="Heat barrel.png" src="../w/images/5/5f/Heat_barrel.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Heat Barrel</b>
</p><p>These skills are essential as they allow you to stay alive longer (<b>Platinum Alter</b>), defeat enemies faster (<b>Platinum Alter, Heat Barrel</b>) and generally save time (<b>Rich's Coin</b>). Other skills that you most likely will want to pick up includes:
</p><p><a href="File_Roundtrip.html" class="image"><img alt="Roundtrip.png" src="../w/images/4/45/Roundtrip.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Round Trip: </b>Round Trip is the absolute best skill for mobbing. Requires a Gatling Gun.
</p><p><a href="File_Qds.html" class="image"><img alt="Qds.png" src="../w/images/b/b1/Qds.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Quick Draw Shot: </b>Quick Draw Shot allows a Rebel to quickly defeat any single-target monsters. Requires a Pistol or any <b>Chain Action</b> enabled firearm (through the usage of <b>Eternal Chain</b>).
</p><p><a href="File_Boundingtrap.html" class="image"><img alt="Boundingtrap.png" src="../w/images/8/85/Boundingtrap.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Bound Trap:</b> This will help you in slowing down enemies giving you more time to deal with them.
</p><p><a href="File_Flicker.html" class="image"><img alt="Flicker.png" src="../w/images/1/1e/Flicker.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <b>Flicker:</b> This will allow you to detonate <b>Bound Trap</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lv99_-_140">Lv99 - 140</span></h4>
<p><u><b>Recommended weapons of each firearms for this level range:</b></u></p><blockquote><p><b>Pistols</b>: <a href="File_Heavenandhell.html" class="image"><img alt="Heavenandhell.gif" src="../w/images/d/d0/Heavenandhell.gif" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13120/heavens-feather-hells-fire-1">Heaven's Feather and Hell's Fire [1]</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Gatling Gun</b>: <a href="File_Minimei.html" class="image"><img alt="Minimei.png" src="../w/images/6/6e/Minimei.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13197/minigun-2">Mini Mei [2]</a></p></blockquote><p>After becoming a Rebel, your next goal is to reach Lv175. In order to make leveling a little faster in this level range, you should pay a visit to F2 of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html">Eden Group</a> and accept quests starting from the Lv100 board. All of the monsters listed below are part of the quest boards, so it's extremely beneficial for you to pick all of these quests up and turn them in after you've hit your quest quota. This way, you'll be able to earn substantial amount of EXP. Alternatively, you may want to visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Leveling_Guide.html#Gramps">Gramps</a>.
</p><p><b>Outside Ice Dungeon:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Desert Wolf</li></ul>
<p>Desert Wolves are aggressive, slow and generally weak. Using a combination of Water-elemental ammunition and <b>Desperado</b> will make quick work of them. Not only that, the item <a href="File_Bloodofwolf.html" class="image"><img alt="Bloodofwolf.png" src="../w/images/1/1a/Bloodofwolf.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/6252/blood-of-wolf">Blood of Wolf</a> that Desert Wolf drops is a popular item that is used in creating some food items, so it's also a good way for you to earn money! (type @wb 6252 in order to find who in the market are actively buying this item!)
</p><p><b>Juperos Dungeon (Lv120+):</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Venatu (drops Crest Piece, can be sold for 2500z each to NPC)</li></ul>
<p>Once you've reached Lv120+, you might want to move on to Juperos Dungeon. This dungeon is notorious for ridiculous amounts of spawns, something that a Gatling Rebel will be very happy to hear. Using a Gatling Gun together with <b>Round Trip</b>, it's entirely possible for Rebels to earn lots of EXP this way. Pistol Rebels can use <b>Desperado</b> or <b>Fire Dance</b>, but <b>Round Trip</b> is highly recommended for its knock-back effect which will probably save your life more than once!
</p><p>Venatu remains to be a good source of EXP even past Lv140, as long as you get a big enough mass of monsters!
</p><p>There's no elemental advantage to be had over Venatu, however, Purification Shot is highly recommended for the usage of <b>Platinum Alter</b>.
</p><p><b>Rachel Sanctuary (Lv120+):</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Vanberk (drops Bloody Rune, can be sold for 1008z to NPC)</li>
<li>Isilla (drops Bloody Rune, can be sold for 1008z to NPC)</li>
<li>Hodremlin</li></ul>
<p>Alternative, you can also visit Rachel Sanctuary. With extremely slow moving monsters like Vanberk and Isilla, they literally pose you no threat at all. Isilla Cards and Vanberk Cards are a good source of zenies too!
</p><p>Since a majority of the monsters here are neutral element, this means you won't have much of an elemental advantage here. Purification Shot is highly recommend for the usage of <b>Platinum Alter</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lv141_-_175">Lv141 - 175</span></h4>
<p><u><b>Recommended weapons of each firearms for this level range:</b></u></p><blockquote><p><b>Pistols</b>: <a href="File_Aresicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Aresicon.png" src="../w/images/a/a0/Aresicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13122/altair-ares">Altea &amp; Ares</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Gatling Gun</b>: <a href="File_Tempesticon.html" class="image"><img alt="Tempesticon.png" src="../w/images/1/11/Tempesticon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13198/tempest">Tempest</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Shotgun</b>: <a href="File_Deathfireicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Deathfireicon.png" src="../w/images/c/ca/Deathfireicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13192/death-fire-1">Death Fire [1]</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Rifle</b>:<b> </b><a href="File_Colorscopeicon.html" class="image"><img alt="Colorscopeicon.png" src="../w/images/7/7f/Colorscopeicon.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/13189/color-scope-2">Color Scope [2]</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Grenade Launcher</b>: <a href="File_Southerncross.html" class="image"><img alt="Southerncross.png" src="../w/images/b/bf/Southerncross.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/28201/southern-cross">Southern Cross</a></p></blockquote><p>At this point of time, it's extremely hard to earn EXP by simply grinding your way through. I highly recommend visiting F2 of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Eden_Group.html">Eden Group</a> to accept quests from the Lv141 - 175 quest board. All of the monsters listed below are part of the quest boards, so it's extremely beneficial for you to pick all of these quests up and turn them in after you've hit your quest quota. This way, you'll be able to earn substantial amount of EXP. Alternatively, you may want to visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Leveling_Guide.html#Gramps">Gramps</a>.
</p><p><b>Nightmare Clock Tower:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Big Ben</li>
<li>Big Bell (F2)</li>
<li>Neo Punk</li></ul>
<p>Nightmare Clock Tower can be accessed through the first level of Clock Tower. At the portal to F2 of Clock Tower F1, there's an NPC that will warp you there for 5000z.
</p><p>Nightmare Clock Tower is not a terribly difficult place to level off, considering that majority of the monsters there you'll encounter are not very fast. However, there ARE monsters that are incredibly hard to defeat (Cursed Box and Cursed Book), so it's recommended that you immediately teleport (using Flywing or if you have the skill Teleport) away once you see them.
</p><p>On F1, you'll find Big Ben and Neo Punk as notable enemies to defeat. Big Ben is weak to Fire while Neo Punk is weak to Earth. I would highly recommend the usage of Holy ammunition regardless of their weaknesses because <b>Platinum Alter</b>'s ATK bonus will more than make up the elemental advantages that you get from using an element of the enemy's weakness.
</p><p>However, if you were to use <b>Heat Barrel</b> rather than <b>Platinum Alter</b>, then it's entirely reasonable to use Fire ammunition for this place.
</p><p>On F2, Big Bell is a neutral element monster, so usage of Holy ammunition is recommended for the usage of <b>Platinum Alter.</b>
</p><p><b>Bifrost Tower:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Cenere</li>
<li>Blue/Yellow Lichtern</li>
<li>Antique Book</li></ul>
<p>Bifrost Tower is another great place for EXP (partly because of Eden Group's quest). At this particular dungeon, you'll most likely use Holy ammunition exclusively because you'll most definitely require the shield from <b>Platinum Alter</b>. The enemies (with the exception of Cenere) moves pretty fast -- you can use <b>Bound Trap</b> to help out with the fast enemies -- so be careful not to get swamped by enemies!
</p><p><b>Outside Bifrost Tower:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Petal</li>
<li>Menblatt</li></ul>
<p>Just outside of Bifrost Tower is another great place for EXP, also partly because of Eden Group's quests. While both enemies are weak to Earth, like previously suggested, Holy ammunition is highly recommended for the usage of <b>Platinum Alter</b>. Petal is capable of ranged attack, so be aware of that!
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_to_Leveling">Alternative to Leveling</span></h3>
<p>If hunting monsters by yourself is not something that appeals to you, there are other various places where you can get EXP.
</p>
<ul><li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Leveling_Guide.html#Gramps">Gramps</a>
<ul><li>Gramps is one of the most common form of leveling for players in NovaRO. For each level bracket you are at, Gramps has 2 quests, with each of them rewarding at least 2 base level upon completion. With a cooldown of 4 hours between each quest, many players would switch between Gramps and Eden Group's quest boards.</li>
<li>As a Rebel, you'll most likely be relegated to the DPS role. As a good majority of parties in Gramps works by having a tank grabbing a gigantic mob, AoE skills are often preferred for DPS classes.
<ul><li>If you use Pistols, you can either <b>Desperado</b> or <b>Fire Dance</b> the whole mob that the tank brings. Be aware that if you don't kill the mob fast enough, chances are that you'll take the aggro from the tank and you'll be dead before you know it!</li>
<li>If you use Gatling Guns, you will use <b>Round Trip</b> for mobs. Round Trip pushes the mobs away, so be wary of how your <b>Round Trip</b> pushes the enemies away.</li>
<li>Despite Shotguns and Grenade Launchers having AoE skills, these firearms AoE skills aren't too great (<b>Shattering Storm </b>has a cast time, <b>Howling Mine </b>takes too long to activate) compared to Pistols and Gatling Guns while in Gramps.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, if you're using Rifles, the only skill with AoE is <b>Hammer of God</b> and it comes with a long cooldown. Consider using other firearms for Gramps!</li>
<li>I personally <b>recommend Pistols and Gatling Guns</b> for Gramps.</li></ul></li>
<li>Gramps are also rotated monthly; so keep a look out!</li></ul></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Instances.html">Instances</a>
<ul><li>Instances are another way for players to gain EXP. Some instance of note would be <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Horror_Toy_Factory.html">Horror Toy Factory</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Old_Glast_Heim.html">Old Glast Heim (Normal</a>)</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Afterword">Afterword</span></h2>
<p>At Lv175, you'll most likely start to branch off to other builds of the Rebel. With so many different weapons to use, I'm sure I have barely scratched the surface of the amount of possible builds for Rebel. If you readers have any suggestions regarding this guide or any builds that you would like to share, please feel free to let me know!
