<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Maestros and Wanderers, also known collectively as Performers, are the third job classes of Bards and Dancers. They are mainly a support class, having a wide variety of unique skills they can use to support their teammates and disrupt their enemies. In many cases, especially for Maestros, they are an indispensable part of an optimal party.
</p><p>They start out as an Archer, which means they're relatively easy to level in the earlier stages, due to having long range offensive skills like Double Strafe and Arrow Shower, as well as access to elemental arrows. Unlike the DPS-oriented Rangers, however, they tend to take on a more supportive or hybrid role from 2nd job onwards.
</p><p>Additionally, unlike many other classes, Performers do not have any essential Transcendent skills. This means that Baby Performers are not too much different functionally compared to adult ones; the only main drawbacks being the reduced MaxHP/SP and less 2nd job Skill Points to spend.
</p><p><i>This guide will only cover the PVM aspect of the gameplay.</i>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Maestro_or_Wanderer">Maestro or Wanderer</span></h3>
<p>It should be noted that there's a stark difference between the two classes, despite sharing many of the same skills.
</p><p><b>Maestros</b> are notably more commonly used in party play, mainly because their signature song, Poem of Bragi, is essential to maximising the DPS output of most classes. In addition, their signature chant Windmill Rush is also more broadly used, as there are more classes that use ATK than there are that use MATK.
</p><p>The downside of this is that they are absolutely required to have a total of 150 INT to make sure they give the full effects of Poem of Bragi. This means that their stat and equipment builds are somewhat more limited, which means they cannot focus solely on increasing damage.
</p><p><b>Wanderers</b> on the other hand, are less commonly sought for in the rando PVM scene, partially because their signature song, Services for You, is non-essential to most parties, and overlaps in function with a Sorcerer's Soul Change. Their signature chant, Moonlight Serenade, is also only useful for a handful of classes like Warlock, Sorcerer, Arch Bishop, and Ninja, which uses MATK instead of ATK. In most cases, you would want to join a guild to make it easier to get parties that synergize with your Wanderer.
</p><p>On the upside, Wanderers don't need to build a specific stat for their supportive function, as Services for You works well even with relatively low INT. This means that they can focus fully on damage, and can reach higher DPS potentials in party play compared to Maestro. In addition, as a Wanderer in a party, you will get the effects from Poem of Bragi if there is a Maestro in your party, making it possible for you to use a Reverberation build in most parties when Maestros usually can't.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats">Stats</span></h2>
<p>The Performer are a very special kind of class, whose stats directly affect the effectiveness of their supportive skills. Their main Stats are DEX, INT, and VIT.
</p>
<table class="wikitable" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Stat
</th>
<th>Notes
</th>
<th style="width: 40%">Affected Songs
</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>DEX
</th>
<td>Increases ATK when using Bow, Instrument, or Whip; increases HIT; reduces Variable Cast Time.
<p>An essential stat for any performer. Aside from its primary effects, it also directly increases the damage of the skill <i>Severe Rainstorm</i>. Having 120 DEX is mandatory for activating Temporal DEX Boots' bonus effects.
</p><p><i>Recommended amount: 120</i>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul><li><i>Poem of Bragi</i> (Bard): Increases Variable Cast Time reduction.</li>
<li><i>Please Don't Forget Me</i> (Dancer): Increases ASPD Penalty.</li>
<li><i>Humming</i> (Dancer): Increases HIT bonus.</li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>INT
</th>
<td>Increases MaxSP and SP regeneration; reduces Variable Cast time; increases MATK.
<p>Resistance: Blind, Sleep, and Silence.
</p><p>Another essential stat for performers, as aside from its primary effects for SP management, it also improves the effects of their most important songs. Additionally, MATK also plays a role in improving the damage of the skill <i>Reverberation</i>.
</p><p>For Maestros, it is absolutely mandatory to have a total of 150 INT (counting bonuses) to be able to give 100% Cast Delay Reduction with Poem of Bragi.
</p><p><i>Recommended amount: 80~120</i>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul><li><i>Poem of Bragi</i> (Bard): Increases Cast Delay reduction.</li>
<li><i>Service for You</i> (Dancer): Increases MaxSP bonus and SP Cost reduction.</li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>VIT
</th>
<td>Increases MaxHP and HP regeneration;
<p>Resistance: Blind, Curse, Poison, Silence, and Stun.
</p><p>An important stat for performers as a support class. As they are often considered an indispensable asset in parties, having high survivability is recommended. It is important to aim for at least a total of 100 VIT (counting bonuses) to gain Stun and Curse immunity.
</p><p><i>Recommended amount: 90~110</i>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul><li><i>Apple of Idun</i> (Bard): Increases MaxHP bonus and Healing amount.</li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>AGI
</th>
<td>Increases FLEE and ASPD.
<p>Resistance: Bleeding and Sleep.
</p><p>A useful stat to raise if you want to do damage. The FLEE and ASPD increase is very useful in the early game, and later on, it also directly increases the damage of the skill <i>Severe Rainstorm</i>.
</p><p><i>Recommended amount:60~80 for support, 100~120 for damage</i>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul><li><i>Assassin Cross on Sunset</i> (Bard): Increases ASPD bonus.</li>
<li><i>A Whistle</i> (Bard): Increases FLEE bonus.</li>
<li><i>Please Don't Forget Me</i> (Dancer): Increases Movement Speed penalty.</li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>STR
</th>
<td>Increases ATK per 5 points when using Bow, Instrument, or Whip; increases weight limit.
<p>Optional stat for Performers. It is usually only raised for increasing Weight Limit, as it has little use besides that.
</p><p>If you really have trouble with your Weight Limit, I would recommend using Gym Passes instead of raising STR too high.
</p><p><i>Recommended amount: 1~40</i>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul><li>N/A</li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>LUK
</th>
<td>Increases ATK, MATK, HIT, and CRIT per 3 points; increases Perfect Dodge per 10 points
<p>Resistance: Various, minor.
</p><p>Optional stat for Performers, as CRIT and Perfect Dodge are rarely utilised by this class.
</p><p>Additionally, this stat only gives a minor contribution to your song's effects, so there's no significant benefit in raising it too high.
</p><p><i>Recommended amount: 1~40</i>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul><li><i>A Whistle</i> (Bard): Increases Perfect Dodge bonus.</li>
<li><i>Fortune's Kiss</i> (Dancer): Increases CRIT bonus.</li></ul>

<p>Keeping in mind that stats only contribute to a small portion of your songs' effectiveness (the larger portion coming from the song's skill level and Musical/Dance Lessons), the example stat builds below will tend more towards maximising damage potential.
</p><p>Take these examples with a grain of salt, and tweak or modify them according to your needs and gear availability. Don't forget that you can always reset at Main Office if you ever need to adjust your stat to new gear or different party setups.

<li>VIT: 94</li>
<li>INT: 100</li>

<li>LUK: 30</li></ul>
<p>This build puts DEX and AGI at the highest priority as they directly boost the damage of <i>Severe Rainstorm</i>, while keeping a good distribution of the other stats.
</p><p>For Maestros, this build gives you a base amount of 100+9 INT. With Clementia, you will need 25 more INT to reach 100% Delay Reduction with Poem of Bragi. Without Clementia, you will need 41 more INT.

<li>VIT: 100</li>
<li>INT: 120</li>

<li>LUK: 30</li></ul>
<p>This build puts DEX and INT at the highest priority to balance between damage and SP upkeep, putting VIT at second priority for survivability. This build works best for supporting smaller parties, or when your party does not have an Arch Bishop. Additionally the higher INT also allows for higher damage potential with Reverberation.
</p><p>For Maestros, this build gives you a base amount of 120+9 INT. With Clementia, you will only need 5 more INT to reach 100% Delay Reduction with Poem of Bragi. Without Clementia, you will need 21 more INT.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills">Skills</span></h2>
<p>Performers have a wide array of unique skills called Songs. They are classified into 3 groups: Solo Songs, Ensembles, and Choruses. For the purposes of this guide, the third job Solo Songs will be called <i>Chants.</i>
</p><p>The following is a list of important skills that Performers must be familiar with in PVE environments. Non-essential skills have been omitted.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2nd_Job_Songs">2nd Job Songs</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Solo_Songs">Solo Songs</span></h4>
<p>These skills require the caster to be wearing an Instrument/Whip to be cast.
</p><p>All of these skills create a 7x7 Area of Effect around the caster that follows the caster as they move until the skill is cancelled. Any player (excluding the performer) that is within the AoE will receive the effect, and the effect lingers on the affected player for 20 seconds after leaving the AoE.

<p><i>Note:</i> If two Bard songs or two Dancer songs combine AoEs, the cells that clash become a Dissonance/Ugly Dance and lose their effects. In such cases, the song must be recast to apply the effects again. However, a Bard song and a Dancer song can combine AoEs with no negative effect.

</td>
<td>Resurrects a dead player with a very small chance of failure, while consuming a 50%~10% of their SP. The target will be revived with HP equal to the SP they had while dead.
<p>This skill is not much different from Resurrection through using a Yggdrasil Leaf, but it does have a noticeably shorter Cast Time, a significantly lighter catalyst (0.2 weight as opposed to Ygg Leaf's 10 weight), and is able to resurrect players who are wearing Evil Druid carded armor or affected with Satan Morroc's Hell Power debuff. However, make sure you're using Lv 5 to minimise the SP penalty. Consumes 1 Regrettable Tear.

<td>When cast on a target who has learned Brandish Spear, Clashing Spiral, Rapid Smiting, Shield Boomerang, or Shield Press, significantly boosts the damage of those skills, with a small chance to reduce the target's movement speed and strip their mount.
<p>When cast on a target without those skills, applies a FLEE and ASPD penalty.
</p><p>This song is considered a <i>Group B </i>song, and therefore can only be replaced by Choruses and Siren Song.
</p><p>This skill is mainly recommended for its debuff effect, as it can be extremely useful to reduce the FLEE of enemies with AGI UP. Particularly enemies like Cecil in Biolab 3, Trentini and Alphoccio in Biolab 4, and Suffering Khalitzburg in Old Glast Heim.
</p><p>Additionally, this skill is a key component in party setups that utilises Spiral Pierce build Rune Knights as the main DPS.

</td>
<td>Charms monsters and players on screen, making them unable to attack the caster temporarily. Higher levels increase AoE, duration, and chance of effect. Duration is reduced by the enemy's level.
<p>Very useful in solo situations as it can "tame" a big mob temporarily, making them stop attacking long enough for you to escape death. Keep in mind, however, that the monsters will only stop attacking the caster. Therefore, in a party situation, the mob will turn to attack your party members instead.
</p><p>Additionally, since this song is considered a <i>Group B</i> song, this can be used to replace other unwanted Group B songs, such as Circle of Nature and Gloomy Day, from your party members. Adversely, this can also replace Song of Mana and Dances with Warg, therefore it's recommended to use this skill sparingly. Keep in mind that this skill does not actually affect the caster, so it will not replace Group B songs from your own character.

<p>An extremely useful offensive skill for leveling as an Archer which also remains useful after advancing to 2nd and 3rd job. Although it's not spammable like Double Strafe due to its fixed animation, it's still useful for dealing extra damage to multiple enemies at once.
</p><p>Additionally, the knockback effect is good for pushing your enemies around, especially to keep them away from you, or to push them into an offensive AoE such as your own Severe Rainstorm, a Sorcerer's Psychic Wave, or a Priest/Arch Bishop's Magnus Exorcismus.

<p>It has considerably high damage (especially when using the right equipment), but the hefty cast delay and lengthy animation makes it somewhat unreliable, especially after advancing to 3rd job and getting Severe Rainstorm.

<td>Creates a rain of arrows in an 11x11 AoE that deals up to 12 hits to all enemies within it throughout its duration. The damage is directly affected by DEX and AGI.
<p>This will be your main offensive skill as Maestro or Wanderer. With the right equipment and element, it can deal as high as 12k damage per hit, or even higher when special buffs like Hawk Eye activates. You cannot switch weapons while the AoE is ongoing, but you can use other Bow skills to maximise your DPS. Bow exclusive skill.

<td>Place a musical note on the ground that when stepped on by an enemy or when its duration runs out, explodes to deal up to 800% ATK + 600% MATK in a 5x5 AoE. Can be cast while playing a Solo Song or an Ensemble.
<p>A notably powerful offensive skill that is overlooked by most performers. Its two main drawbacks are that the damage is unaffected by Ranged modifiers, and its trigger range is only 1x1 instead of 3x3 like most ground trap skills. With Bragi, this skill easily out-damages both Arrow Shower and Double Strafe as complements to Severe Rainstorm. Take this skill if your party setup allows you to use it to its full potential.

<p>A burst damage skill that shines especially in PvP situations, due to the massive SP drain capability. However, due to it being single-target with a lengthy 4 second cooldown, it is a lot less reliable in PvM compared to Severe Rainstorm.

<p>When it comes to skills, Maestros and Wanderers do not often need to change their builds, as their core skills will always remain the same. Usually, the only skills that are switched in and out are the Optional ones, such as Ensembles, Frost Joke/Scream, Gloomy Day, and Improvised Song.
</p><p>Below are example builds with various choices of Optional skills being taken. Keep in mind that none of these are "the best build", and you should customise them according to your play-style and your party's needs.

This instant max ASPD is extremely useful for plant-type bosses like Sarah in <a href="Sarah_and_Fenrir.html" title="Sarah and Fenrir">Sarah and Fenrir</a> and Antonio in <a href="Horror_Toy_Factory.html" title="Horror Toy Factory">Horror Toy Factory</a>, which takes 1 damage from any attack and therefore requires high ASPD to kill off quickly.
</p><p>You will rarely need to use this weapon, but it's good to have it in storage for the times you need to use it.

<h3><span id="Weapon_Swapping.2FSong_Flashing"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapon_Swapping/Song_Flashing">Weapon Swapping/Song Flashing</span></h3>
<p>Unlike other classes which mostly stick with a single weapon in battle, Performers need to constantly swap between a Bow for casting damage skills and an Instrument/Whip for casting supportive skills. The easy way to do this is to place your weapons into your hotkeys, by simply dragging them from the inventory to your hotbar.
</p><p>One very important thing to know about weapon swapping is: if you currently have an active Solo Song or Ensemble, swapping your weapon will cancel the song, regardless of how long it has played, with no adverse effects whatsoever. This makes weapon swapping a much more effective way to cancel songs compared to the skill <i>Adaptation to Circumstances</i>.
</p><p>Below is a comparison between cancelling songs by using Adaptation and using weapon swapping.
</p>
<table style="text-align:center">
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="../LateCourteousBlobfish.html" /><br /><b>Using Adaptation </b>
</td>
<td><img src="../PrestigiousWanConure.html" /><br /><b>Using weapon swapping</b>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The technique of casting and cancelling several songs in quick successions as shown above is called <i>Song Flashing</i>. This technique allows you to apply 3 or more song buffs to your party members and then return to damage dealing in an instant. This can be made even more effective by having 2 identical Instruments/Whips in your inventory (for example, 2 Harps of Nepenthes or 2 Electric Eels), which makes it not disappear from your hotkey when you have one equipped.
</p>
<table style="text-align:center">
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="../BrokenBestCrocodile.html" /><br /><b>Weapon swapping with 2 identical instruments</b>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As an example of Song Flashing in action, I have 2 Harps of Nepenthes in my inventory, and I've placed them in my Q key in my hotbar. I've also placed Poem of Bragi, Apple of Idun, and Assassin Cross on Sunset in my W, E, and R keys respectively. Additionally, I have my Bow of Storms in my 1 Key, and the skills Double Strafe and Severe Rainstorm in my 2 and 3 keys.
</p><p>To perform Song Flashing, I follow the sequence of pressing Q &gt; W &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; R. After that, I switch to the offensive by swapping to my bow and casting Severe Rainstorm, while using Double Strafe for more damage
</p><p><img src="../NeighboringCourteousCardinal.html" />
</p><p><i>Special Note</i>: Due to how long and loud the song SFX are, Song Flashing may make your game too noisy. You can download this set of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/5062-shortened-performer-songs-download-link/">Shortened Performer SFXes</a> to fix that problem, and tell your friends or guildmates to do so too so you can flash your songs with no worry.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Soul_Link">Soul Link</span></h3>
<p>The Soul Linker class (2nd job of Taekwon Kid) can cast a skill called <i>Bard and Dancer Spirits</i>, which if cast on a performer, will put you in a Soul Linked state for up to 6 minutes.
</p><p>The benefits of being Soul Linked are:
</p>
<ul><li>All Solo Songs will also affect the caster</li>
<li>When performing a Solo Song, movement speed is greatly increased</li>
<li>If you have learned a Solo Song at level 10, you will be able to cast a counterpart song from the other gender's arsenal at level 10 as well.
<ul><li><span style="color:Blue"><i>Poem of Bragi</i></span> enables <span style="color:#F60000"><i>Fortune's Kiss</i></span></li>
<li><span style="color:DarkOrange"><i>Apple of Idun</i></span> enables <span style="color:DeepPink"><i>Service for You</i></span></li>
<li><span style="color:DarkRed"><i>Assassin Cross on Sunset</i></span> enables <span style="color:Green"><i>Please Don't Forget Me </i></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#4B0090"><i>A Whistle</i></span> enables <span style="color:DarkGoldenrod"><i>Humming </i></span></li>
<li>and vice versa.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Note that when casting songs from the other gender's arsenal, it will not be as effective as when cast by the actual owner of the skill, due to not having the respective Lessons skill. A prime example is if a Wanderer under soul link casts Poem of Bragi, she will not be able to give 100% Cast Delay reduction even with 150 INT because she lacks the skill Musical Lessons. She can only reach 100% Cast Delay reduction if she has 250 INT.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_Synergy">Class Synergy</span></h3>
<p>This is a set of knowledge that a Performer must have. Every class benefits from different song buffs, so you should know which songs to cast when, and when you should save SP instead of spamming songs.
</p><p>These tables below list the most important skills for supporting each class. Keep in mind that your party will have <i>several</i> different classes, so pick your skill priorities wisely using these as your guide.
</p><p>Note that only a few of these listed classes gain any significant benefit from <i>Dance with Warg</i>. Therefore, in most cases, you can default to keeping <i>Song of Mana</i> on to aid your party's SP upkeep.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Supportive_Functions">Other Supportive Functions</span></h3>
<p>While it's true that a Performer's role in a party is often just to sing and chant, you must not forget about all your other useful supportive functions.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Poem of the Netherworld</b>: A snare skill that acts like a hybrid of Ankle Snare and Fiber Lock; can be placed on the ground but can be cast from afar. Many PVM Performers seem to be oblivious about this skill, but it can be extremely useful in places like Biolabs and Old Glast Heim floor 2, where there are fewer, but deadly monsters. The only drawback is that it does not affect boss monsters.</li>
<li><b>Ensembles</b>: This is another thing that many PVM Performers take for granted. When you're in an instance party with a Performer of the opposite gender (which shouldn't be rare if you're in a PVM guild), you should consider whether or not you'll be able to utilise an ensemble. Drums on the Battlefield, in particular, is extremely useful in instances like Bios Island, Morse's Cave, and Demon God, where you spend a lot of time staying in one place and whittling down on the MVP's massive HP pool. <br />Keep in mind that unlike Solo Songs, the effects of Ensembles disappear as soon as the song is cancelled. This makes it impractical to use Severe Rainstorm as your damage skill, but that should not be an issue overall, since Drums on the Battlefield should boost your party's collective DPS higher than your Severe Rainstorm can. If you want to do damage while casting an Ensemble, you can use Reverberation or cast Longing for Freedom and use Arrow Vulcan.</li>
<li><b>Death Valley</b>: While at a glance it does not seem any different from Yggdrasil Leaf's Resurrection, this skill shines due to its ability to resurrect people wearing Evil Druid Armor. This is definitely useful for parties with no ABs, where your party members can take full advantage of Evil Druid Armor without the fear of not being able to be resurrected.</li>
<li><b>Gloomy Day</b>: Few people know this, but this skill can counteract the dreaded monster skill AGI UP. While it doesn't remove the buff entirely (and does not work on certain monsters), the FLEE penalty is significant enough to allow most classes to land their attacks. Just make sure the enemy you're attempting to debuff does not have the skills that would make Gloomy Day buff them instead.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Damage_Dealing">Damage Dealing</span></h3>
<p>Although not essential, being able to deal decent secondary damage while providing support is the one thing that separates great Performer players from everyone else (and from Bragi dual clients).
</p><p>To help you understand how to keep a balance between damage and support, here are a few key things to remember:
</p>
<ul><li>Solo Song effects last for 20 seconds after the song is cancelled.</li>
<li>Chants and Frigg's Song lasts for 60 seconds, and has a 2-second Cast Delay</li>
<li>Severe Rainstorm locks you from swapping weapons for 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Severe Rainstorm also has a 7 second Cooldown; or 5 second if using Bow of Storms.</li></ul>
<p>With the above points in mind, this means:
</p>
<ul><li>You can cast Severe Rainstorm up to 3 times before needing to re-flash your Solo Songs.</li>
<li>On every third re-flashing cycle, you will need to re-cast your Chant and Frigg's Song.</li></ul>
<p>If you master the timing of these series of skills, you will be able to maximise the efficiency of both your Supportive and Offensive functions as a Performer.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leveling">Leveling</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Novice">Novice</span></h3>
<p>As with any other Novices, you can simply register at Criatura Academy to instantly reach Job Level 10. Alternatively, you can just hit a few porings at the field to quickly gain levels. You can then job change at Prontera Main Office by talking to Job Master.
</p><p>You can choose to do some of the extra side-quests around Izlude to gain some additional Base Levels before you job change. Some notable ones I would recommend are the Shop Helper Quest, Learning First Aid skill, and Red Herb Quest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_Job">First Job</span></h3>
<p>As an Archer, you are the easiest first job to level, since you are able to deal ranged damage, have access to all elements, and have strong offensive skills like Double Strafe and Arrow Shower.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Job_change_-_Level_26">Job change - Level 26</span></h4>
<p>First of all, put all of your status points into DEX. Open your inventory and double-click on the Quiver that Job Master gave you to open it. Equip the arrows and your Novice Composite Bow, and place your Novice Potions to one of your hotkeys.
</p><p>Go to the fields and shoot some Porings or other monsters until you reach Base Level 26. Don't forget to turn on @autoloot to automatically collect the monster drops.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_26_-_40">Level 26 - 40</span></h4>
<p>Go to <a href="Eden_Group.html" title="Eden Group">Eden Group</a> by using the command "@go Eden". Register with the NPC Lime Evenor, then talk to Instructor Boya to take her Equipment Quest. Before going to the quest, raise the skill Double Strafe to max and place it in one of your hotkeys. Also, once again, put all your status points into DEX.
</p><p>Once you've done that, talk to the Warper, select Dungeons &gt; Payon Dungeon. Walk outside and talk to the Eden NPC, and do what he tells you. You should be able to kill Zombies and Familiars with 1 Double Strafe, and Skeletons and Poporings with 2 Double Strafes. <i>Don't be afraid to spam your skills until your SP runs out!</i> Whenever you run low on SP, simply use @go to warp back to town, use the Healer, and warp back to the dungeon. After finishing the quest, go back to Eden Group and take the equipment rewards.
</p><p>Go back Payon Dungeon to gain more levels, while keeping on putting more DEX. You should be able to kill everything even easier with your new equipment. As for Skills, prioritise getting Vulture's Eye to level 9 and Arrow Shower to level 10.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_40_-_Job_change">Level 40 - Job change</span></h4>
<p>Before moving on to the next area, sell all your random loot to any shop NPC to earn some zeny. Then, buy 1000 Silver Arrows from the Universal Tool Dealer, which you can find at any town, and equip them.
</p><p>Talk to the Warper and select Dungeons &gt; Orc Dungeon. The monsters here are mostly slow and very weak to Holy, which makes it easier for you to kill them. Make sure to keep a distance from them and kill them using Double Strafe. If you find a lot of them grouped together, use Arrow Shower to kill all of them simultaneously. If you run low on Potions, you can open the Beginner Box that Job Master gave you to get some more, or you can buy Fresh Fish from the Comodo Chef Assistant.
</p><p>Once you reach level 51, go back to Instructor Boya at Eden Group to take her Orc Dungeon quest. The quest NPC is located right outside Orc Dungeon.
</p><p>You can also job change as soon as you reach job level 40, but I would recommend maxing out the skill Improve Concentration before job changing.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_Job">Second Job</span></h3>
<p>As a Bard or Dancer, you won't be getting any notable Offensive skills, so if you're leveling Solo, you'll be sticking with Double Strafe and Arrow Shower until you've hit level 99. However, you do start to get some nice supportive skills, which means you will make a unique contribution if you're leveling with a party.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Job_change_-_Level_71">Job change - Level 71</span></h4>
<p>If you haven't yet, finish Instructor Boya's quest and claim the reward back at Eden Group. Then, continue leveling in Orc Dungeon. Make sure you keep Improve Concentration active as it gives you a significant amount of DEX which adds to your damage, and AGI which helps with ASPD.
</p><p>At Base Level 71, your stats should be 80 DEX, 50 AGI, and 30 INT, with the rest at 1. As for skills, prioritise maxing Musical Lessons and Poem of Bragi if you're a Bard, and Dance Lessons and Service For You if you're a Dancer.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_71_-_91">Level 71 - 91</span></h4>
<p>Talk to Instructor Ur at Eden Group to get the next Equipment Quest, then talk to the 71-85 Board and take Evil Druid and Wraith hunting quests. Stock up on some more Silver Arrows, then use the warper to get to Glast Heim St. Abbey.
</p><p>Talk to Johan, then go in and kill the required amounts of monsters. This map has a much lower mob density compared to Orc Dungeon, so you will mainly be using Double Strafe to kill. Watch out for Mimics that walk very fast and can catch you off guard. Once finished with the quest, return to Eden Group to claim the equipment reward. Make sure you choose Eden Bow III, not the Guitar nor the Whip. Don't forget to also talk to the board again to claim the EXP reward.
</p><p>Continue leveling at Glast Heim St. Abbey, or warp to Glast Heim Entrance and walk out to Hunt Petites. You can have a chance to get a Crimson Mace, which is highly valuable (especially if its element is Holy, Neutral, or Fire), and Petite's Tails which are also valuable. You can sell these items by setting up a vending store on a Merchant character or shouting in the #trade channel in-game.
</p><p>At Base Level 91, your stats should be 99 DEX, 70 AGI, 35 INT, 10 VIT, rest at 1. As for skills, max out Assassin Cross on Sunset if you're a Bard, and Fortune's Kiss if you're a Dancer. The rest is entirely up to you.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_91_-_99">Level 91 - 99</span></h4>
<p>At this level, you have the choice to either go with a Party or go Solo.
</p><p><b>If you prefer going with a party</b>, you should be prepared to start taking your supportive role. Go to the Comodo Weapon Dealer and buy 2 of the cheapest Instrument/Whip for your <a href="#Weapon_Swapping/Song_Flashing">weapon swapping</a>, and hotkey them as well as your Songs.
</p><p>For the leveling itself, <b><a href="Gramps.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Gramps">Gramps</a></b> is the way to go. Go to Eden Group and look for chatrooms LFM-ing (Looking for Members) for 85+ Gramps, and join them. If there are none, you can set up your own LFP (Looking for Party) for 85+ Gramps or shout in the #lfg channel in-game and wait to be recruited. Take the quest from the Gramps Hunting Board, then go into the map. Your main role in a Gramps party is to flash songs and help kill stray mobs using Double Strafe and auto-attacks, and occasionally Arrow Shower.
</p><p>Once you've finished the two 400 kill counts, DO NOT TURN THEM IN! Keep them for when you rebirth so you can gain a lot of levels instantly.
</p><p><b>If you prefer going Solo</b>, forget about songs for now. Go to Eden Group 2nd floor and take some hunting quests from the <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_91_-_99" title="Eden Group">91-99 Quest Board</a>. The main ones I would recommend doing are Siroma, Roween, Stapo, Solider, Freezer, Injustice, Rybio, and Dark Priest. Use the @mi command to see their respective elements, and buy some elemental arrows from the Arrow Dealer at Payon or Prontera so you can kill them faster. Keep the Rotten Meats dropped by Roween as you can turn them in at the 100-110 board later on.
</p><p>As with the Gramps quest, once you finished the kill counts, DO NOT TURN THEM IN! They will also be helpful for reaching high levels instantly after you rebirth.
</p><p>Once you reach level 99, go back to Job Master in Prontera and Rebirth.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebirth">Rebirth</span></h3>
<p>Once you rebirth to a High Novice, go to the fields and kill some Porings to reach Job Level 10, then change into High Archer.
</p><p>After that, go to Port Malaya and do the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village">Cautious Village Quest</a> which is a short quest that rewards you with a ton of EXP. The Blue Gems and Holy Waters can be bought from any Universal Tool dealer. Once you finish, you should be around Level 76/50, after which you can change job to Clown or Gypsy.
</p><p>After advancing to Trans 2nd Job, go back to Eden Group and turn in your Gramps or 91-99 Board Quests. This should instantly get you near or at level 99/70. If you still need a few more levels, just kill some Stapos to get you there.
</p><p>Before job changing your stats should roughly be 99 DEX, 78 AGI, 50 INT, 30 VIT, rest at 1. As for skills, you can follow one of the <a href="#Skill_Build">Skill Builds</a> listed above, depending on which one suits your playstyle best.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Third_Job">Third Job</span></h3>
<p>As a Maestro or Wanderer, you will usually find it easier to level with a party, as your offensive abilities are not very reliable compared to other classes like Rangers, Rebels, or Royal Guards. However, with some key equipments, you can still deal decent AoE Damage with Severe Rainstorm. Therefore, you still have the option of either going Solo or with a Party, depending on your preference.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_99_-_115">Level 99 - 115</span></h4>
<p>When you've just started out as a Maestro or Wanderer, these are the two options to pick from:
</p><p><b>If you prefer going with a party</b>, prioritise maxing out Frigg's Song first and foremost, then Severe Rainstorm, Windmill Rush/Swing Dance, and finally Voice Lessons.<br /> Your best leveling method here will be <b>Gramps</b>. Find or gather a party in Eden Group, take the kill quests, then go in. While inside, here are a few things to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Frigg's Song</b> is an extremely valuable skill as it gives a very significant HP-regen per second, but you must keep in mind that it has a huge SP cost, so you should time its usage strategically. Having this skill will allow your party to fare relatively well even without a Healer.</li>
<li><b>Severe Rainstorm</b>, if used with the right elemental arrow, can be extremely powerful, and can even be the main AOE damage source of your party if nobody else has AOE skills. Therefore, if your party already has a healer but is lacking in damage, utilise your SP to kill with this skill instead of heal with Frigg's Song. Keep in mind that it takes a long time to cast, so you should position yourself away from the mob when casting it.</li></ul>
<p><b>If you prefer going Solo</b>, prioritise maxing out Severe Rainstorm, then Windmill Rush/Swing Dance, Voice Lessons, and Poem of the Netherworld.<br />Your method of leveling as a Solo player will be Eden Group Board Quests. While still level 99, you can take the board quests I've mentioned in the 90-99 section to gain an easy head start before moving on to the harder quests.
</p><p>Once you reach <b>level 100</b>, you can take these <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_100_-_110" title="Eden Group">Board Quests</a> at Eden Group 2nd floor.:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Desert Wolves</b>, outside of Ice Dungeon: Use Crystal Arrows against them to have elemental advantage, and use Double Strafe and Arrow Shower to kill them quickly. They should be slow enough not to be too challenging, as long as you don't mob too much. Once you have Severe Rainstorm, you'll be able to kill them even easier. Just make sure you cast from further away, as the skill does have a long cast time. If you're a Maestro, Windmill Rush will help you improve your damage; and if you're a Wanderer, Swing Dance will help you outrun the mobs and position yourself more easily. Make sure you loot the Blood of Wolf and the rare Crimson Daggers, as they are quite valuable.</li>
<li><b>All 4 Kobolds</b>, 2 maps north of Lighthalzen: Each of these have different elements, so you should use Elven Arrow for best damage. They also have differing movement speeds, some slow and some fast, and the Archers can attack from a distance, which make them quite tricky. To deal with this, always prioritise killing the Kobold Archers first, using Double Strafe or auto-attacks, while keeping yourself at a distance from the melee Kobolds. Once the Archers are dealt with, you can cast your Severe Rainstorm at your character's position to anticipate the faster Kobolds coming near you. It's okay if the slower ones didn't go into your Severe Rainstorm AOE quick enough, since you can easily deal with them individually with Double Strafe or auto-attacks afterwards.<br /> Don't forget to also take the Gathering Quest for <i>Blue Hair</i>.</li>
<li>If you collected <i>Rotten Meats</i> from Roweens earlier, you can take the Gathering Quest for those and turn them in immediately for quick EXP.</li></ul>
<p>Since you don't need to worry about party members, you can simply warp back to town and use the Healer if you run out of SP or die, so you can forget about using Frigg's Song and managing your SP for now. Once you're done with those, turn all of the quests in at the board.
</p><p>At <b>level 111</b>, you can go to the <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_111_-_120" title="Eden Group">111-120 Board</a> and take these quests:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Nepenthes/Centipede Larva</b>, east of Midgard Camp: You can access this map by first doing the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cat_Hand_Services#New_World_access_quest">Cat Hand Access Quest</a> (short 2 minute quest) then talking to the NPC at the eastern end of Mid Camp. These are great picks because you have a chance to get Harp of Nepenthes, the best Instrument for Maestros, and Stem of Nepenthes, one of the best Whips for Wanderers. The Nepenthes are stationary, so you can easily kill them from afar. However, keep an eye out for the Hillslion and Centipede Larvae, as they can kill you in seconds. If you have Poem of the Netherworld, you can use it to snare them before they get too close, making it easy for you to kill them.</li>
<li><b>Venatus</b>, Juperos: For these, you need to have either a very fast cast time (using Sound Amplifier accessories) or uninterruptible casting (using Phen Card or Bloody Butterfly Card). Be sure to also take the Gathering Quests for <i>Rusty Screws</i> and <i>Fragments</i> if you decide to hunt these.<br /> The main strategy is to simply teleport, cast Severe Rainstorm, then teleport away before they murder you. As long as you can kill them in 1 cast, this should be easy enough. The Crest Pieces dropped here are also quite expensive if sold to NPCs, so you can farm some money while you level.</li></ul>
<p>Once you're done, turn them in and you should be near or at level 120.
</p><p>At level 115, your stats should roughly be 110 DEX, 80 AGI, 60 INT, 48 VIT, rest at 1.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_115_-_145">Level 115 - 145</span></h4>
<p>You've now entered the mid-game, where you can start experiencing the real feel of Renewal by going into various Instances and gaining various mid and end-game gears.
</p><p><b>If you prefer going with a party</b>, prioritise maxing out Death Valley, Song of Mana Level 3 (or above), then Siren Song(optional), and finally Poem of the Netherworld.<br /> Your main leveling method will still be <b>Gramps</b>, and you will still be doing mainly what you were doing in the 85-114 level. However, during this stage, it should be noted that many other classes will have a higher DPS potential than you, therefore you should make sure that you're fulfilling your expected supportive role by casting Songs (mainly Poem of Bragi or Service for You) and Chants. If there happens to be another Performer in your party, make sure you cast Song of Mana to help with the party's SP upkeep.
</p><p>Besides traditional leveling, it's also a good idea to start tackling some <a href="Instances.html" title="Instances">Instances</a> to get some equipment. Joining a guild is a good idea for this, as it's easier to make parties with people you know than it is with strangers. See the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/forum/28-guild-recruitment/">NovaRO Guild Recruitment Board</a> to find guilds to join.
</p><p>Some <b><a href="Instances.html" title="Instances">Instances</a></b> you can try are:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="Airship_Assault.html" title="Airship Assault">Airship Assault</a></b> (level requirement: 125) is a particularly good instance which rewards you with very useful equipment. You don't need to kill the boss since the items are dropped by the regular monsters, but you should still be able to finish the instance relatively easily with one Arch Bishop and one reliable DPS (usually Ranger or Rebels).</li>
<li><b><a href="Infinite_Space.html" title="Infinite Space">Infinite Space</a></b> (level requirement: 100) is another good one which rewards you with materials for one of your best choices in armor, the Ancient Armor of Rift. However, you will need either a bigger party, or some level 145+ characters to carry you through the instance.</li>
<li><b><a href="Nightmarish_Jitterbug.html" title="Nightmarish Jitterbug">Nightmarish Jitterbug</a></b> (level requirement: 120) is the hardest of the three, and might need 6 or more people around your level to finish, or a few level 145+ characters to carry you through it. It rewards you with Teeth of Jitterbug, which you can exchange to get a random gear. The main thing you want from here is the Bow of Storms, as well as Pendant of Harmony and Pendant of Chaos, which you can combine to make a Pendant of Maelstrom, the best accessory you can use.</li></ul>
<p><b>If you prefer going Solo</b>, prioritise maxing out Siren Song(Optional but very useful), Frigg's Song, then Death Valley and Song of Mana Level 3.
</p><p>If you're still below level 121, you can go back to either Juperos or the Nepenthes map to hunt the monsters already mentioned above.
</p><p>At <b>level 121</b>, your best choices of <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_121_-_130" title="Eden Group">Board Quests</a> are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Vanberk, Isilla, and Hodremlin</b>, Rachel Sanctuary; with Gathering Quest for <i>Will of the Darkness</i>: Vanberks and Isillas are very slow, and spawn in very high numbers in the map, but are Neutral element. Hodremlins are much faster and deadlier, but have a lower spawn rate and is weak to Holy. You should be able to kill them easily with Severe Rainstorm, as long as you keep a distance from them. Be careful of Beholders; even though they're non-aggressive, they can attack from range, can dispel, and can drain your SP. If you happen to gain their aggro, try to kill them immediately.</li>
<li><b>Tatacho, Hillslion, and Centipede</b>, Manuk west-south, with Gathering Quest for <i>Fur</i>: These are a bit more challenging than the Rachel Sanctuary ones, but should still be relatively easy. Poem of the Netherworld is your best friend, and having quick casting or uninterruptible cast will definitely help a lot here. Keep an eye out for the Hardrock Mammoth that spawn here, and teleport away when you see it.</li></ul>
<p>At <b>level 131</b>, your best choices for <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_131_-_140" title="Eden Group">Board Quests</a> are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>One-Horn and Two-Horn Scaraba</b> at Scaraba Dungeon F1: Warp to Scaraba Hole via the Warper and walk out. These monsters are vicious and can kill you in seconds. However, you can easily snare them with Poem of the Netherworld before they get anywhere close. Use Severe Rainstorm with Fire Arrow coupled with Double Strafe to kill them while they're ensnared, and don't hesitate to recast Poem of the Netherworld in front of them in case they break free before you manage to kill them.</li>
<li><b>Antler and Rake Scaraba</b> at Scaraba Dungeon F2: These guys are slightly tougher and deadlier, but you can use the same strategy to kill them. Watch out for the Queen Scaraba MVP, and teleport away if you see her near you.</li></ul>
<p>At <b>level 141</b>, your best choices for <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_141_-_175" title="Eden Group">Board Quests</a> are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Angra Mantis, Pom Spider, and Little Fatum</b> in Bifrost fields, with Gathering Quest for <i>Angel Magic Powder</i>: As with Scarabas, these monsters are relatively quick and vicious, so you will need to snare them with Poem of the Netherworld to be able to kill them effectively. Additionally, they spawn in higher numbers compared to Scarabas, so you must keep in mind that you can only have 5 active snares at once, so you don't accidentally bite more than you can chew.</li>
<li><b>Parus</b> in Hazy Forest, with Gathering Quest for <i>Round Feather</i>: This one is optional, as it requires you to enter an instance to kill. However, the instance also contains the other 3 aforementioned monsters, so you may choose to take all 4 of these and hunt them within the instance. Just keep in mind that the instance is comprised of small islands, meaning you won't have a lot of space to maneuver about.</li>
<li><b>Neo Punk and Big Ben</b> at Nightmare Clock Tower: Warp to Clock Tower and walk to [239, 226], talk to the NPC to enter. These are actually very easy, as they spawn in small numbers, are slow, and the Big Ben is non-aggressive. They do have a lot of HP, though, so it might take 2 Severe Rainstorms to kill them. Just make sure to keep them snared while you're killing them.</li></ul>
<p>Besides the traditional leveling methods above, you can also try out these two <b><a href="Instances.html" title="Instances">Instances</a></b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="Ghost_Palace.html" title="Ghost Palace">Ghost Palace</a></b> (level requirement: 120) is a Solo instance from which you can get Thanatos Weapons. Although Thanatos Weapons are not the best choice for Performers, you can still sell these for easy money. Some valuable Thanatos weapons to sell are Thanatos Katar and Thanatos Hammer. The main thing you should watch out for is the Ragged Zombies, which attack from range, and the Flame Skulls, Dullahans, and Skoguls, which are quick and deadly. Be wary of your positioning and kill the mobs slowly, and you should have no trouble finishing this instance.</li>
<li><b><a href="Sara%27s_Memory.html" title="Sara&#39;s Memory">Sara's Memory</a></b> (level requirement: 99) is an instance where you can get various Stat Foods. The monsters here are quite slow and weak, and the only real threat is the final boss. However, you don't actually need to finish the instance, as most of the rewards come from the regular mobs. However, if you do, you will get a nice bonus EXP when you report back to Leon the Adventurer.</li></ul>
<p>At level 145, the only main stat priority is 120 DEX, while the rest can roughly follow one of the <a href="#Stat_Builds">Stat Builds</a> listed above. What's more important at this point is to get some of the key equipment needed for optimal performance, both while leveling and while doing instances.
</p><p>These <b>Key Equipment</b> include:
</p>
<ul><li><img src="../data/kRO/inventory/22008.png" />&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/?module=vending&amp;action=view&amp;id=22008">Temporal DEX Boots</a></span>: An absolute MUST GET. While it may be hard to join or organise an Old Glast Heim party below level 145, clean Temporal Boots and Temporal Crystals should still be readily available at the market. If you've collected Gold Coins from Daily Rewards and Events, you can sell them for 50k~60k zeny each to help earn some extra zeny to buy this item. It will be somewhat costly, but it'll be a worthy investment. See the wiki page on <a href="Temporal_Boots.html" title="Temporal Boots">Temporal Boots</a> for more information on crafting these boots.</li>
<li><img src="../data/kRO/inventory/18123.png" />&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/?module=vending&amp;action=view&amp;id=18123">Bow of Storms [1]</a></span>: Another must get if you're dealing damage. It's usually sold for cheap in the market (I've bought some for ~500k). If nobody is currently vending them for cheap, shout in #trade and you might get a good deal.</li>
<li><img src="../data/kRO/inventory/2899.png" />&#160;<span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/?module=vending&amp;action=view&amp;id=2899">Sound Amplifier [1]</a></span>: This is not essential in the end-game, but will definitely help tremendously while leveling. They are usually sold for around 1m~2m, which is not too expensive. You can choose to buy 2 of these to completely eliminate Variable Cast Time, but usually only 1 is enough.</li>
<li><img alt="Card" src="../w/images/5/59/Card.png" decoding="async" title="Card" width="24" height="24" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/?module=vending&amp;action=item&amp;id=4077">Phen Card</a></span> or <img alt="Card" src="../w/images/5/59/Card.png" decoding="async" title="Card" width="24" height="24" /> <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/?module=vending&amp;action=item&amp;id=4327">Bloody Butterfly Card</a></span>: An alternative to Sound Amplifier, this will help you cast your Severe Rainstorm while being attacked. Not a must have, but can be useful.</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_145_-_175">Level 145 - 175</span></h4>
<p>This point in the game can be considered the PvM endgame, because you will have the ability to share EXP with level 175 characters, and you will have met the level requirements of most instances at this point. I recommend leveling with a party at this level, but I will still give a few Solo recommendation for the times you don't have a party to level with.
</p><p><b>If you prefer going with a party</b>, aim for getting Dance with Wargs and optionally Gloomy Day or Reverberation. <br /> If you're a Maestro, you MUST have 150 INT with bonuses at this point, therefore you should start figuring out which gear you can afford to reach that number. If you're a Wanderer, try to focus on maximising your damage potential by stacking ATK and/or DEX through your gear, so your party will see you as a valuable party member, not just someone who stands around and dances.
</p><p><b>Gramps</b> will remain to be the most viable way to level at this point. As with the previous levels, try your best to balance between support and offense, manage your SP well, and try to synergise with your party members. See the <a href="#Class_Synergy">Class Synergy</a> section above for more information.
</p><p>Besides that, here are some important <b><a href="Instances.html" title="Instances">Instances</a></b> to tackle:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="Old_Glast_Heim.html" title="Old Glast Heim">Old Glast Heim</a></b> (level requirement: 130): One of the most important instances in the current meta, as every class benefits from using <a href="Temporal_Boots.html" title="Temporal Boots">Temporal Boots</a>. Do note that this instance comes in 2 difficulty levels: Normal and Hard mode. You should try finding a party for Normal Mode first before trying Hard Mode, just so you get a feel for how the Instance works. Maestros will find it especially easy to find parties for this one, as there's often recruiters for 4-man OGH Hard Mode parties in #lfg.</li>
<li><b>Fire Basin Instances</b> (level requirement: 160): These instances are often abbreviated as BMD (Bios/Morse/Demon). To access them, you need to finish the <a href="Dimensional_Travel.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Dimensional Travel">Dimensional Travel</a> (level requirement: 140) pre-requisite quest. If you have a high enough damage, you might be able to do the pre-requisite alone, but I would recommend organising a small party to do it with you.
<ul><li><a href="Bios_Island.html" title="Bios Island">Bios Island</a>: A relatively straightforward instance where your party just needs to clear monsters from 3 maps and then fight an MVP. If you're a Maestro, you can pretty much get away with simply casting Bragi for your party members, but nevertheless, being able to do extra damage to help them will always be appreciated. This Instance rewards you with a chance to get a <a href="Prize_of_Hero.html" title="Prize of Hero">Prize of Hero</a> which contains various useful body armor.</li>
<li><a href="Morse%27s_Cave.html" title="Morse&#39;s Cave">Morse's Cave</a>: This instance somewhat tricky, as it has a section where your party is separated into 2 immobile groups. In the case where you get grouped up with other support classes (Arch Bishops, especially, but sometimes also Sorcerers and other Performers), this is where you will need to step up and do some damage, on top of your usual support duties. This Instance also rewards you with a chance to get a <a href="Prize_of_Hero.html" title="Prize of Hero">Prize of Hero</a>.</li>
<li><a href="Demon_God.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Demon God">Demon God</a>: The hardest of the 3, due to having 4 MVPs with a cumulative of 336 Million HP to kill within 1 hour. You will need to be at your optimal performance to help your party finish this instance in time. Bring proper elemental arrows, prepare SP consumables, and be ready to cast Ensembles if the situation allows it. This instance rewards you with a Squad Prize, containing one Essence of Evil and various goodies.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><a href="Nightmarish_Jitterbug.html" title="Nightmarish Jitterbug">Nightmarish Jitterbug</a></b> and <b><a href="Infinite_Space.html" title="Infinite Space">Infinite Space</a></b> are still worth running. You'll mostly be running them to get a DEX or INT enchanted Armor/Decoration of Rift and Pendants of Harmony/Chaos.</li>
<li><b><a href="Endless_Tower.html" title="Endless Tower">Endless Tower</a>/<a href="Endless_Cellar.html" title="Endless Cellar">Endless Cellar</a></b> (level requirement: 99): While they don't have good rewards in particular, they do contain 26 and 22 MVPs respectively, which adds up to a huge amount of EXP. The good thing is that most ET/EC parties will definitely want a Maestro or Wanderer; Maestro for Bragi, and Wanderer for infinite SP, so keep an eye out for recruiters in #lfg, or just make your own party!</li>
<li><b><a href="Sara%27s_Memory.html" title="Sara&#39;s Memory">Sara's Memory</a></b> (level requirement: 99): If you haven't tried this one already, you definitely should. This instance is very easy, so you should be able to Solo it with Severe Rainstorm. The foods you get from here, particularly the INT, DEX, and AGI foods, are extremely useful later on; and you can get a lot of them in a single run.</li></ul>
<p><b>If you prefer going Solo</b>, you pretty much have all the skills already, so you're free to build the rest of your skills depending on your preference. <br /> Your priority for gear at this point would be for damage, as you won't be supporting anyone while playing Solo, anyway. Stack as much ATK and/or DEX in your stat and equipment build as possible, while maintaining a balance in survivability and SP upkeep. If you want to join a Party at any time, you can simply reset your stats at Main Office.
</p><p>You will be going back to the <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_141_-_175" title="Eden Group">141-175 Hunting Quests</a> already mentioned above, with some additions:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Menblatt and Petals</b> in Eclage field, with Gathering Quests for <i>Fancy Fairy Wing</i> and <i>Unripe Acorn</i>: Warp to Bifrost Tower via the Warper and walk out. These monsters are a bit tricky as Menblatts can attack from 3 cells away, while Petals are entirely ranged. You can still snare them, but make sure you stay out of their extended attack ranges before you cast your Severe Rainstorm. Having either quick or uninterruptible cast would be very helpful here. Also, you might get a chance to get a Menblatt Card, which is your best Garment card choice.</li>
<li><b>All 4 Lichterns, Cenere, and Antique Book</b> at Bifrost Tower, with Gathering Quest for <i>Bookclip in Memory</i>: Although the monsters here have a lot more HP than the ones in Bifrost field, they actually have slower movement and attack speeds. Try to walk slowly and take the monsters a few at a time, making sure to snare before they get too close. Staying near walls is a good idea, so the monsters won't attack you from behind. Also keep in mind that Yellow Lichterns are Ghost element, so neutral arrows will not damage them. I recommend using Silver or Shadow arrows here for consistent damage to all the enemies.</li></ul>
<p>Besides these, you will still get value from doing Ghost Palace and Sara's Memory, but I would recommend trying out party Instances which I've mentioned above, since it should be easy to get a party as a Performer anyway.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Afterword">Afterword</span></h2>
<p>I'm dualityDiscretion, often known by my IGN Novitom or Novi. I've been playing Performers for a couple of years and the reason I wrote this guide is because I'm sick of people playing their Performers as song slaves. I wanna show people that there's a lot to be improved with most Performer players' gameplay, and that just because you're playing a support class, doesn't mean you have to be useless outside of your primary functions.
</p><p>If you have any questions, feedbacks, or comments, you can find me as dualityDiscretion in the NovaRO forums and as Dualdisc#8257 on discord.
</p><p>Also, if you're interested, I have an RO-themed webcomic at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://tapas.io/series/PORINGS">http://tapas.io/series/PORINGS</a>.
