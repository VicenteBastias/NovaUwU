<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Royal Guards (commonly abbreviated as RG) are the 3rd job classes of Crusaders. They are a very versatile class, excelling as a Tank due to their high MaxHP modifier, exclusive access to several high-DEF gears, and a wide range of defensive skills; and a noteworthy offensive class both in PvM and PvP due to their powerful offensive skills. They even have supportive capabilities which are unique to their class.
</p><p>As a Swordsman-based class, they are moderately easy to level due to their naturally high HP pool and strong offensive skills even in the early game. They also have a natural advantage in movement speed due to having access to a mount.
</p><p>This guide will cover mainly the PvM aspect of the game.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats">Stats</span></h2>
<p>The Royal Guard is a Melee Tank-specialist class. Therefore, their main Stats are VIT, STR, and DEX.
</p>
<ul><li><b>VIT</b> is the most essential stat for an RG. It increases MaxHP and the recovery rate of healing items. It also provides SoftDEF that can decrease incoming damage by a flat amount as well as resistance against Stun and other status effects. <br /><i>All builds should have at least 100 VIT including bonuses; Pure Tanks should have 120 Base VIT.</i></li>
<li><b>STR</b> is an essential stat for an RG to boost their Attack Power. Having high STR not only allows them to deal a good amount of damage through their offensive skills, such as Overbrand and Banishing Point; but it also provides a higher weight limit which helps them carry extra potions for tanking. <br /><i>At least 90 STR is recommended for all RG builds, except for Pure Tanks which can have less.</i></li>
<li><b>DEX</b> is another essential stat for any RG who intend to use offensive skills. It adds HIT which allows the RG's attacks to connect with enemies. <br /><i>Tank builds should have at least 70 DEX; while Pure Tanks can ignore the stat entirely.</i></li>
<li><b>INT</b> is an important stat which helps an RG by increasing MaxSP, seeing how RGs have a relatively low SP pool while their offensive skills are somewhat SP-costly. The increased MaxSP also helps for the SP upkeep of skills like Reflect Damage and Force of Vanguard. Additionally, INT provides a bit of MDEF which helps at reducing magical damage. <br /><i>At least 40 INT is recommended for all RG builds.</i></li>
<li><b>AGI</b> is a semi-optional stat for RGs. Tank-builds benefit from the Flee that AGI provides, but due to the fact that Flee penalty is applied when taking on several mobs at once, Flee is somewhat irrelevant. Damage-oriented builds may benefit from the ASPD bonus, but it is considerably difficult to reach very high ASPD on an RG without sacrificing too much of the other stats. <br /><i>80 AGI is sufficient for most builds; Pure Tanks should have 100 AGI.</i></li>
<li><b>LUK</b> is another semi-optional stat for RGs. They can provide Perfect Dodge and Resistance against several Status Effects which helps with survivability, but in most cases it isn't needed. <br /><i>Tank builds should not have any more than 70 LUK. Pure Tanks, on the other hand, can raise this to 90 LUK or beyond.</i></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills">Skills</span></h2>
<p>Royal Guards have a large number of useful self-buffs, as well as a few offensive and supportive skills. The following is a list of important skills that an RG should be familiar with. Less important skills have been omitted.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Passive">Passive</span></h3>
<p><a href="File_RG_INCR.html" class="image"><img alt="RG INCR.png" src="../w/images/1/1a/RG_INCR.html" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Increase_HP_Recovery">Increase HP Recovery</a>
</p><p>Allows a faster HP regen while standing still and increases the effectiveness of HP recovery items. This is an essential skill for all RGs as it substantially increases survivability with the boost of Healing items. Level 10 is recommended.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_FAIT.html" class="image"><img alt="RG FAIT.png" src="../w/images/9/99/RG_FAIT.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Faith">Faith</a>
</p><p>Increases MaxHP by 200 per skill level. Level 10 is recommended for the survivability and as a prerequisite to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Devotion">Devotion</a>.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_PECO.html" class="image"><img alt="RG PECO.png" src="../w/images/2/24/RG_PECO.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Peco_Peco_Ride">Peco Peco Riding</a> and <a href="File_RG_CAVM.html" class="image"><img alt="RG CAVM.png" src="../w/images/f/f1/RG_CAVM.html" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cavalier_Mastery">Cavalier Mastery</a>
</p><p>An essential skill which allows the RG to ride a mount which increases Movement Speed. Cavalier Mastery should be at level 5 to negate the ASPD penalty while riding a mount.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_SPRM.html" class="image"><img alt="RG SPRM.png" src="../w/images/6/6c/RG_SPRM.html" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Spear_Mastery">Spear Mastery</a>
</p><p>Adds Mastery ATK when wielding One-handed and Two-Handed Spear type Weapons. It should be maxed by default as a prerequisite to Spear Quicken. Pure Tanks, however, may only get level 1.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Self_Buffs">Self Buffs</span></h3>
<p><a href="File_RG_ENDU.html" class="image"><img alt="RG ENDU.png" src="../w/images/9/93/RG_ENDU.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Endure">Endure</a>
</p><p>Removes the flinching effect when receiving damage, allowing the RG to walk or cast skills without being interrupted when the buff is active. This skill is useful for casting skills like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Prestige">Prestige</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shield_Spell">Shield Spell</a> whilst tanking damage, or simply for pulling large groups of enemies with ease. Level 10 is recommended.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_AUTO.html" class="image"><img alt="RG AUTO.png" src="../w/images/c/c4/RG_AUTO.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Guard">Auto Guard</a>
</p><p>Allows the RG to completely block incoming Physical attacks by up to a 40% chance. Requires a Shield to be cast. Level 10 is recommended for tanking, but level 5 is sufficient otherwise.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_REFS.html" class="image"><img alt="RG REFS.png" src="../w/images/9/9c/RG_REFS.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Reflect_Shield">Reflect Shield</a>
</p><p>Reflects a percentage of incoming damage back to the attacker. This skill is useful for keeping an enemy's Aggro on the RG instead of on other party members. Requires a Shield to use. Level 5 is sufficient.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_SHRI.html" class="image"><img alt="RG SHRI.png" src="../w/images/8/84/RG_SHRI.html" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Shrink">Shrink</a>
</p><p>An optional platinum skill that allows the RG to push an enemy back when Auto Guard procs. Helps to allow some breathing space when tanking multiple or rapid-hitting mobs.
</p><p><a href="File_RG_DEFE.html" class="image"><img alt="RG DEFE.png" src="../w/images/8/83/RG_DEFE.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Defender">Defender</a>

<h2><span id="Hybrid_Tank_Build_.28PvM.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Hybrid_Tank_Build_(PvM)">Hybrid Tank Build (PvM)</span></h2>
<p>This build is the most basic kind to be used in the PvM setting. It maximises the RG's versatility to allow one to cover multiple roles in the party effectively.
</p><p>A Hybrid Tank Royal Guard mostly takes the role of a Tank by utilising their defensive self-buffs to survive enemy attacks. With skills like Auto Guard, Prestige, and in some cases, Defender; they minimise the damage they take and in turn improve their survivability. Meanwhile, support skills such as Devotion and King's Grace allow them to keep their party members alive. In addition to that, with points invested in STR and DEX, they can dish out significant amounts of damage with Overbrand and Banishing Point when it is needed.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_2">Stats</span></h3>
<p>Here is an <i>example</i> Stat build for a Hybrid Tank RG. The important thing with this build is to have high VIT and INT for higher MaxHP, DEF, and MDEF.
</p><p>Feel free to fine-tune according to your gear selection and play-style.
</p>
<ul><li>STR: 100</li>
<li>AGI: 80</li>
<li>VIT: 120</li>
<li>INT: 100</li>
<li>DEX: 75</li>
<li>LUK: 43</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_2">Skills</span></h3>
<p>Hybrid Tank RGs play a semi-supportive role by keeping Party member alive through tanking enemy hits. Their main skills revolve around the self-buffs and supportive skills, but offensive skills will also be an essential part of this build.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Auto Guard Lv10</b> allows you to potentially block <b>30%</b> of all incoming physical damage completely. This buff should <i>always</i> be active.</li>
<li><b>Force of Vanguard Lv5</b> gives you <b>15%</b> extra MaxHP, which may be the difference between surviving or dying in the case of powerful attacks like an MVP's Earthquake.</li>
<li><b>Prestige Lv5 </b>gives you up to <b>200+ </b>HardDEF. With Assumptio, this may allow you to block 60% of damage via DEF alone.</li>
<li><b>Shield Spell Lv3 </b>gives you an increase of HardDEF according to your shield's refine level. The better the refine, the more DEF can be gained through this skill. Due to the randomness of the buff given, you need to actually check your Status Window to see when the buff actually applies.</li>
<li><b>Defender Lv5</b> gives you <b>80%</b> resistance to ranged attacks in exchange for a reduced movement speed. It also gives a passive DEF increase to Prestige. Only activate this buff in certain situations, such as against Cecil, Randel, and Flamel in Biolabs dungeon or Raydric Archers and Root of Corruption in <a href="Old_Glast_Heim.html" title="Old Glast Heim">Old Glast Heim</a>.</li>
<li><b>Reflect Shield Lv5 </b>or above allows you to reflect up to <b>40%</b> of incoming damage back to the enemy. The damage alone isn't viable for killing mobs, but it helps in keeping enemy aggro, preventing them to switch targets to your Party Members.</li>
<li><b>Reflect Damage</b> <b>Lv5</b> allows you to reflect <b>40%</b> of incoming damage in a 3x3 AoE around you, which allows for a higher damage output. However, due to the high SP upkeep, it should only be cast in certain cases, such as when tanking a hard-hitting MVP.</li>
<li><b>Shrink Lv1</b> is an optional self-buff which allows you to reduce enemy DPS by proccing a <b>knockback</b> when Auto Guard procs. Note that Boss Monsters are not affected by this skill's knockback effect.</li>
<li><b>Devotion Lv5</b> allows you to absorb the damage taken by your party members. This skill also allows the receiving party member to cast spells without being interrupted. Use this skill on your key party members, such as your Healer, your Rangers when they use Unlimit, or, in the case when you're not tanking, the Steel Body Sura or White Imprison Warlock.</li>
<li><b>King's Grace Lv5 </b>is a useful strategic skill that may be used to heal, clear debuffs, and provide absolute immunity to you and party members around you for a short duration. This helps a lot in keeping yourself and some party members alive when your party is nearly getting wiped. <i>Only use this skill in emergencies, and prioritise your healers.</i></li>
<li><b>Spear Quicken Lv10</b> gives a useful ASPD boost for auto-attacking or spamming Banishing Point. It also gives a passive 50% ATK per level bonus to Overbrand.</li>
<li><b>Overbrand Lv5 </b>is the main offensive skill of a Tank RG. With Spear Quicken Lv10, it gives <b>(1500% + ~700% + ~600%)</b> ATK damage in a single, powerful AoE. Additionally, with its powerful knockback effect, it can be used defensively to sweep enemies away from party members.</li>
<li><b>Cannon Spear</b> <b>Lv5</b> is a moderately strong, useful ranged AoE attack which casts instantly, allowing it to be cast even when mobbing. Its damage is highly reliant on raw STR, and can be boosted further with Shield Spell Lv1. Useful for snatching multiple enemy Aggro from party members instantly, but keep in mind its eccentric AoE.</li>
<li><b>Banishing Point Lv5</b> is similar to Cannon Spear, but is spammable with a single target. Useful to catch enemy aggro, or with a high enough ASPD, can be used to dish out a decent DPS.</li>
<li><b>Moon Slasher Lv3 </b>is a quick point-blank AoE attack that is mostly useful to catch enemy aggro and chaining skills.</li></ul>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/rgd.html?10JkINcKkFuFbxGS5rCbnaSasdskDqx1">Here is an example Skill Build for a Hybrid Tank RG</a>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy">Strategy</span></h3>
<p>The Hybrid Tank RG build is most optimised for doing party play, standing in the forefront and tanking enemy damage (MVPs especially), or defending the party unit mainly by using Overbrand. In such scenarios, the first thing to remember is to make sure you have a functional party: You as a Tank and at least one Damage dealer (often also called DPS) and one Healer. Your main priorities while taking this role is to keep enemies away from your party members (i.e. Keeping enemy's Aggro) and surviving continuous damage; <i>dealing damage is optional</i>.
</p><p>With that in mind, there are several ways to improve your survivability:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Gear up</b>: Your equipment plays a vital role in reducing the damage you take. In the case of MVPs, you should at least have an Alice-Carded Shield to use. Having a high-refine shield also boosts the effect of your Shield Spell Lv3. Additionally, Bathory Card is to be considered when your enemy is capable of casting Grand Cross of Darkness (examples of mobs which use this skill include Amdarias and Grudge of Royal Knight in <a href="Old_Glast_Heim.html" title="Old Glast Heim">Old Glast Heim</a> and Demigod and Despair God Morroc in <a href="Temple_of_the_Demon_God.html" title="Temple of the Demon God">Temple of the Demon God</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Self-buffs</b>: The self-buffing skills are the RG's most valuable tools. Make sure Auto Guard, Force of Vanguard, Prestige, and Shield Spell Lv3 is always active. Reflect Shield can be active at all times, or can be swapped with Reflect Damage, depending on the circumstances. Take note of enemies that cast Dispel or inflict Silence, and make sure you're able to recast your Self-buffs if they are dispelled.</li>
<li><b>HP Recovery Items</b>: Despite having a Healer in your party, it's still important to have your own means of healing your own HP. For general PvM, the best choices of healing items include Mastela Fruits, Condensed White Potions, and Red Raffle Saps. Yggdrasil Berries or Seeds are also important to have, when you need to heal yourself instantly. If you have access to HP Increase Potions and Enriched White Potion Z, you should use them to increase your survivability even more.</li>
<li><b>Other Recovery Items</b>: Carrying a number of SP recovery items like Grape Juice or Mora Mandarins is also important, especially when tanking mobs that has SP Drain. Additionally, It's always a good idea to bring some Green Potions, because your Healer won't always know when you've been Silenced, Blinded, or inflicted with Hallucination. Having a self-sufficient Tank is often key to a successful party.</li>
<li><b>Communicate with your Healer</b>: Most times, it is important to make sure that your healer casts Safety Wall and Assumptio on you at all times to minimise the damage you take. Telling them when you need/don't need healing also helps by minimising the risk of the healer running out of SP.</li></ul>
<p>Your main role in a party is to tank, especially MVPs. With this in mind, the playing strategy is relatively simple. With all your self-buff activated (minus Defender, except in certain cases), run towards the monster that is to be tanked and start auto-attacking. Activate Devotion on key party members beforehand if necessary, and keep the enemy on you at all times. Your main goal is to survive the battle until your damage dealer manages to kill the monster.
</p><p>Take note of your healer's Safety Wall if they cast one. It's common for them to accidentally miss by a cell or two, therefore you may need to reposition yourself, or ask the healer to recast it.
</p><p>Always keep an eye on your HP bar. Don't hesitate to spam your healing items or use a Yggdrasil Berry/Seed when it's needed, especially when you've been hit by a burst damage such as Sonic Blow or Earthquake.
</p><p>In a case where you die but your party survives, make sure to re-cast all your self buffs after being resurrected before you go back to the MVP again. In most cases, the MVP would be scattering your party at this point, therefore it's important to try and lure it away to give your party a chance to regroup and get back into optimal damage-dealing formation.
</p><p>In a case where your party is getting wiped out (such as by an Earthquake or Hell's Judgement) with your healer and damage dealers dead, use King's Grace immediately. This will make the MVP stop attacking and sometimes even step away, giving you a chance to run to your party once the skill ends and resurrect your healer.
</p><p>If you decide to cast skills such as Overbrand, Moon Slasher, or Burst Attack to deal additional damage, make sure to auto-attack during the skill delay to make sure you don't lose Aggro.
</p><p>Since you're holding the responsibility of keeping your party alive, bringing a <i>Token of Siegfried</i> at all times is a good idea. It will allow you to revive yourself with full HP and SP in case you and your party gets wiped.
</p><p>Once you master these strategies, you may find yourself as a never-dying tank, which your party would be glad to have.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pure_Tank">Pure Tank</span></h3>
<p>The Pure Tank is a sub-build of the Tank RG. This build sacrifices all damage potential while maximising survivability. With this build you can ignore offensive skills while opting to get higher levels of defensive and supportive skills such as Auto Guard Lv10, Reflect Shield Lv10, Piety, and even Gospel. As for stats, this build ignores DEX completely; rendering offensive skills useless, while distributing stats in LUK and AGI for Flee and Perfect dodge. <i>Note that this build is only recommended for very specific party-play circumstances.</i>
</p><p>Below is an <i>example</i> Stat build of a Pure Tank RG.
</p>
<ul><li>STR: 69</li>
<li>AGI: 100</li>
<li>VIT: 120</li>
<li>INT: 100</li>
<li>DEX: 1</li>
<li>LUK: 100</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Damage-Oriented_Tank_Build_.28PvM.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Damage-Oriented_Tank_Build_(PvM)">Damage-Oriented Tank Build (PvM)</span></h2>
<p>The Damage-Oriented Tank is sort of a sub-build of the Tank RG. This build focuses more on maximising the damage output of Overbrand and Banishing Point, while still keeping the tanking capabilities, albeit sacrificing a small bit of survivability.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stats_3">Stats</span></h3>
<p>Below is an <i>example</i> Stat build for a Damage-Oriented Tank RG. The 120 STR is essential for getting the ATK bonus from Temporal Boots of STR and Brown Rat/Wakwak Card, which are key equipment choices for this build. More DEX can be added in exchange for less VIT or INT if you're using a Menblatt Card instead.
</p><p>Feel free to fine-tune according to your gear selection and playstyle.
</p>
<ul><li>STR: 120</li>
<li>AGI: 100</li>
<li>VIT: 100</li>
<li>INT: 80</li>
<li>DEX: 75</li>
<li>LUK: 43</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills_3">Skills</span></h3>
<p>The skill build of a Damage-Oriented Tank build is not much different from a Hybrid Tank Build. The main difference lies in the skill point allocation being more focused on Damage-dealing and less on Support.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Overbrand Lv5</b> will be your main offensive skill for this build, due to its massive damage and wide AoE. This skill allows you to do substantial AoE DPS similar to a Rune Knight's Dragon Breath when you have Poem of Bragi and elemental advantage over your enemies.</li>
<li><b>Banishing Point Lv10</b> will be your secondary offensive skill. Its natural spammability and high damage potential makes it ideal for finishing off single targets very quickly.</li>
<li><b>Moonslasher Lv3</b> is an auxiliary skill, mainly used as a crowd-control tool with its immobility effect in combination with Overbrand's knockback effect.</li>
<li><b>Cannon Spear Lv5</b> is an optional skill, but with proper stats and gears, it can one shot low-level mobs, making it a much more convenient option than Overbrand in a farming situation.</li>
<li><b>Spear Quicken Lv10</b> is your main Self-buff for this build as it would help you reach the high ASPD needed to spam Banishing Point effectively.</li>
<li><b>Shield Spell Lv1</b> is an essential Self-buff for this build. With the right shield, this skill can give up to +130 ATK which would boost your damage significantly. It is also important to note that the buff stays even if the shield is taken off.</li>
<li><b>Auto Guard Lv5</b>, <b>Reflect Shield Lv5</b>, and <b>Shrink Lv1</b> are still your staple Self-buffs. There is no reason not to have these active as long as you have a shield equipped.</li>
<li><b>Inspiration Lv5</b> is optional, but would make a huge difference if you decide to use it. You can easily double your regular DPS while this buff is active, but keep in mind that you will lose HP and SP continuously, making it important to be ready to use potions.</li></ul>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill4/rgd.html?10JkINcFkFuQbxGS5GCbnrfqFbdkDak1">Here is an example Skill Build for a Damage-Oriented Tank RG</a>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_2">Strategy</span></h3>
<p>As the name implies, the Damage-Oriented Tank RG is specialised in Damage, be it in Solo or Party play, while also retaining its capability to Tank when needed. Due to the nature of the RG's offensive skills, they will often need to be face-to-face with the enemy to deal damage effectively. Below are a few key points to using this build optimally.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Using Overbrand as a main damaging skill:</b>
<ul><li><b>Gear up to maximise ATK:</b> Due to the fact that Overbrand is Melee, your gear should focus on increasing ATK value. Specific Gear options are listed in the Equipment section below.</li>
<li><b>Learn to land the skill accurately:</b> The eccentric cross-shaped AoE of the skill often confuses new players. Therefore it's important to do some practice with landing it in the right spot during the leveling stage.</li>
<li><b>Have a Maestro with you:</b> This is not essential, but Overbrand becomes spammable when you are under the effect of Poem of Bragi. This makes it an especially powerful skill in tight spaces where you can corner your enemies, or against boss monsters which are immune to knockback.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Using Banishing Point as a main damaging skill:</b>
<ul><li><b>Gear up to maximise ASPD and Ranged Damage:</b> Maximising the DPS of Banishing Point relies greatly on your ASPD. You should get at least 184 ASPD to spam the skill effectively. Specific Gear options are listed in the Equipment section below.</li>
<li><b>Use AGI and DEX-Boosting Foods and ASPD Consumables:</b> At a minimum, +6 or +7 AGI and DEX foods from <a href="Sara%27s_Memory.html" title="Sara&#39;s Memory">Sara's Memory</a> instance is essential (of course, having +20 and +10 foods would be optimal). Aside from that, Berserk Potion and Enriched Celermine Juice is a must. These will help you significantly to reach higher ASPD</li>
<li><b>Use the Smartcast feature from <a href="NovaExt.html" title="NovaExt">NovaExt</a>:</b> The Smartcast feature is capable of spamming a skill much faster than any player can, therefore it's essential to use the feature to maximise your DPS with Banishing Point.</li>
<li><b>Wear Leeching gear and prepare SP potions:</b> Banishing Point is an <i>extremely SP-expensive skill</i>, especially considering its spammability. Having equipment with SP-leeching bonuses and bringing Grape Juice or Mora Mandarins is essential for making this build work.</li>
<li><b>Take Off Your Shield:</b> This is <i>optional</i>, but if you're fully focused on damage you can take off your shield as soon as you've gotten your Shield Spell buff. This will allow you to regain the -5 ASPD penalty from wearing a shield instantly.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Using Cannon Spear for farming:</b>
<ul><li><b>Gear up to maximise STR:</b> Cannon Spear is one of the unique skills that has its damage increased directly by a stat; in this case, STR. Therefore, stacking more STR is a good idea to increase this skill's damage. Specific Gear options are listed in the Equipment section below.</li>
<li><b>Learn to land the skill accurately:</b> Similar to Overbrand, Cannon Spear has an eccentric AoE: A tunnel AoE that only works in 8 directions around the caster (east, west, north, south, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest). The best strategy is to cast it when you're directly east, west, north, or south of your target, to minimise the risk of missing.</li>
<li><b>Use STR-Boosting Foods:</b> This is <i>optional</i> as this skill is mostly used for farming. However, due to the abundance of +4~+6 STR foods from <a href="Sara%27s_Memory.html" title="Sara&#39;s Memory">Sara's Memory</a>, there is no reason not to use these foods to boost your damage further.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Novice">Novice</span></h3>
<p>The Novice Stage is quick and easy to go through. Just by registering to Criatura Academy, you should be at Job level 10 already. Doing the Shop Helper Quest is also useful to get Novice Fly Wings to use as you go along.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_Job">First Job</span></h3>
<p>As a Swordsman, you will have access to two noteworthy offensive skills: Magnum Break and Bash. These two skills will make leveling as a Swordsman relatively easy, compared to other classes.
</p><p>The Cotton Shirt and Novice Spear is adequate for getting you up to Second Job, but it is also a good idea to get <a href="Eden_Group.html#Equipment_Quests" title="Eden Group"> Eden Group Equipments</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_11_-_26">Level 11 - 26</span></h4>
<p>If you haven't reached level 11 yet as a Swordsman, go south of Prontera and kill some Porings to earn a few levels. Raise some DEX and STR and don't bother with the rest of the stats for now.
</p><p>Register at the <a href="Eden_Group.html" title="Eden Group">Eden Group</a> and take the <a href="Eden_Group.html#Level_11_-_26" title="Eden Group"> Spore Hunting quest</a>. Pick up a couple of Concentration potions from the Tool Dealer, then start killing <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1014">Spore</a></span> at the field east of Payon town with regular attacks until you finish the quest. Make sure you have the @autoloot <a href="Player_Command.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Player Command">Player Command</a> active at 100% so you can earn random loot to sell to NPCs, and there's also a chance you'll get a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4022/spore-card">Spore Card</a>, which might be useful later on. You can then submit the quest back in Eden Group HQ.
</p><p>Aim to get Bash Lv10 and Magnum Break Lv10 as soon as possible, all while keeping on raising DEX and STR.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_27_-_40">Level 27 - 40</span></h4>
<p>Talk to <a href="Eden_Group.html#Instructor_Boya_(Level_12-60)" title="Eden Group"> Instructor Boya</a> to get her equipment quest. Go to Payon Dungeon(or Ant Hell if you're level 33 already) and do what the quests tell you. Having Bash and/or Magnum Break should help a lot here. Claim the equipment rewards back in Eden Group HQ after you finish the quest (Either the Sabre or the Slayer is good), then continue leveling until you reach Base level 40. Make sure you have 40~50 DEX at this point, with decent STR and some points in VIT and AGI. Ignore INT and LUK as they are useless at this point.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_40_-_Job_change">Level 40 - Job change</span></h4>
<p>Go to Orc Dungeon floor 1 and use Magnum Break to kill the mobs there. You will have an elemental advantage against these monsters, since they are Undead element, which means they take more damage from Magnum Break's Fire Property attack, making it an easy place to level. It's a good idea to stock on Fresh Fish (purchasable from the Comodo Chef Assistant) if you run out of Novice/Intermediate Potions from your Beginner box.
</p><p>When you reach Base Level 51, you may choose to get Instructor Boya's next quest, which is also located in Orc Dungeon.
</p><p>As a pre-trans class, you may choose to Jobchange at Job level 40 without any disadvantage. However, make sure you have Magnum Break Lv10 and Endure Lv10 when you Job change.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_Job">Second Job</span></h3>
<p>It's relatively easy to level as a Crusader, due to having access to Holy Cross, which does 900% damage with a Two-handed Spear type Weapon. You also have Magnum Break, which is still a reliable AoE to use at these higher levels.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Job_change_-_Level_70">Job change - Level 70</span></h4>
<p>Continue leveling in Orc Dungeon with Magnum Break until you reach Base Level 70. Try to get Holy Cross Lv10 and Cavalry Mastery Lv5 as soon as possible, and make sure you have 60~70 DEX at this point. Keep adding more STR for better damage while putting some points in VIT for higher MaxHP and AGI for faster ASPD.
</p><p>If you have been collecting and selling your loot, you should have enough money to buy a Lance from the Prontera Weapon Dealer, which can double your Holy Cross damage due to its weapon type.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_71_-_90">Level 71 - 90</span></h4>
<p>Talk to <a href="Eden_Group.html#Instructor_Ur_(Level_60_-_100)" title="Eden Group"> Instructor Ur</a> to get his equipments quest, and talk to the 71-85 board to get the Evil Druid and Wraith hunting quests. Grab a few Awakening Potions from the tool dealer and a Lance from the Prontera Weapon Dealer, then go to Glast Heim St.Abbey and finish the quests. You should be able to one-shot the mobs with Holy Cross, due to the elemental advantage. Having Spear Quicken also helps you dish out damage quicker.
</p><p>It is advisable for you to get Eden Group Spear I for the reward, as it is a good weapon to use as a Royal Guard at level 99 - 120.
</p><p>After you've finished Instructor Ur's quest, there are several areas you can choose to go to. You can continue hunting Evil Druids and Wraiths(which should be a piece of cake) while using the Board Quests for more EXP, or you can earn some Zeny by farming for Crimson Weapons.
</p><p>Ground Petites located east of Glast Heim Entrance would be the easiest choice, as they are Earth 1 element, therefore take 50% more damage from Magnum Break's Fire property attack. The Crimson Mace that they drop is useful for Geneticists and Suras, and is therefore a popular and valuable item to sell in the market.
</p><p>Another option is Jaguars and Headless Mules in the field outside of Brasilis town, the map of which is littered with various other mobs as well. Jaguars are Earth 2 element, and therefore take 75% more damage from Magnum Break. However, the Headless Mules themselves are actually Fire 3 element, which means they are immune to Magnum Break, and thus should be killed using Holy Cross. Jaguars drop Crimson Knuckles, which may be useful for Suras; while Headless Mules drop Crimson Katars, which are extremely valuable for Guillotine Crosses.
</p><p>Lastly, Stem Worms in the field 1 map north and 1 map east of Lighthalzen drops Crimson Spears, which are useful for you as an RG. These monsters are Wind 1 element, which means they don't receive more damage from either Magnum Break and Holy Cross. Use both skill in combination depending on the circumstances. Additionally, this map also contains Metalings, which drop Crimson Revolvers, valued by Gunslingers and Rebels.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_91_-_99">Level 91 - 99</span></h4>
<p>Go to the 2nd floor of Eden Group Headquarters and grab a few quests from the Level 91-99 board. It is recommended to avoid Heater, Shinobi, and Evil Nymph, due to the difficulty reaching the place and the risk of encountering MVPs while you hunt. You should be able to reach 99 with 6~10 quests, so you can skip submitting the quest and keep the rewards for after rebirthing.
</p><p>If you didn't take Instructor Ur's quest at level 71, you can also take his quest now. Be sure to take the Siroma and Roween hunting quests from the 91-99 board as well while doing this quest.
</p><p>Make sure to keep the Rotten Meat which is dropped by Roweens, as they can be turned in for EXP at the 100-110 board.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebirth">Rebirth</span></h3>
<p>Leveling as a reborn character can be done with the same strategy. It's important to note, however, that some Criatura Academy quests are no longer available if you're a High Novice. In such case, you might need to level manually by hitting Porings or other low-level mobs.
</p><p>If you've saved a few 91-99 Board quests, you can start turning them in one by one as soon as you job change into a High Swordsman. A good trick to know is that you are able to close your game by using Alt+F4 or using the close window button if you are playing in windowed mode. This allows you to interrupt the NPC dialogue, preventing yourself from wasting substantial amounts of EXP rewards if you've already hit the max level.
</p><p>Talk to the board and turn in one quest, which should bring you up to Job Level 50, then interrupt the dialogue by closing your game. Log back in and change into a Paladin, then go back and turn in the rest of the quests.
</p><p>Additionally, you can also do the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Cautious_Village">Cautious Village</a> quest, which is a very simple quest which can earn you a huge amount of EXP with virtually no effort. I found it best to do this after you've jobchanged into a Paladin, before you turn in the rest of your 91-99 quests
</p><p>If the board quests aren't enough for you to reach 99/70, you can try hunting in Glast Heim Prison for Injustices and Rybios. The Injustices drop Crimson Katars which can be sold for a decent price, as they are useful for Guillotine Crosses. You may also choose to farm Crimson Maces from Soliders at Turtle Dungeon, Crimson Rods from Bathories at Clock Tower Basement (which may also drop a Bathory Card which will be useful to you later on), Crimson Revolvers from Metalings in the field south of Einbroch, or Crimson Spears from Stem Worms.
</p><p>Alternatively, you can try doing <a href="Halves%27_Royal_Guard_Class_Guide.html#Gramps" title="Halves&#39; Royal Guard Class Guide"> Gramps</a> by joining a 85+ party. More information can be found in the Gramps section below.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Third_Job">Third Job</span></h3>
<p>As a Royal Guard, it is important to start using a shield and start familiarising yourself with the role of a Tank. You will lose your single-target damage potential with Holy Cross, but you will gain access to Overbrand, a much stronger AoE Skill, as well as the ability to utilise Shield-exclusive skills.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_99_-_120">Level 99 - 120</span></h4>
<p>When you start out as an RG, your first priority is to get Overbrand Lv5. If you still have any leftover 91-99 quest at this point, you can turn them in, and choose the Doubled Job EXP reward, so you're able to get the skills faster. Otherwise, you can hunt any of the monsters mentioned in the previous section until you get the skill.
</p><p>Stats wise, you should aim to get 120 STR at around level 130~145 so you can utilise the bonuses from Temporal STR Boots. Balance the other stats with at least 70 DEX, Moderately High AGI and VIT with some INT. Leave adding LUK to after you're level 145.
</p><p>As soon as you get Overbrand Lv5, you will have many options in terms of mobs to hunt. Two of the best choices are <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1134">Kobolds</a></span> (2 Maps North of Lighthalzen) and <span class="plainlinks"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/monster/1106">Desert Wolves</a></span> (South of Ice Dungeon); both are also in the 100-110 Board in Eden Group HQ. The Blue Hair dropped by Kobolds can also be turned in for EXP at the same board, and if you've kept some Rotten Meat, you can turn those in, as well. Take this opportunity to practice landing your Overbrand on the ground accurately.
</p><p>At level 110, it is a good idea to take the quests for Dark Pinguicula, Naga, and Cornus. Dark Pinguiculas have a chance to drop Rosa Shields, which is one of the best shields you can use, and Dark Pinguicula Card is also extremely valuable. Nagas have a chance to drop Crimson Spears, which will be useful to you if you manage to get a high refine for it. Be careful of their Water Ball, though. Your best bet is to try to kill them with Banishing Point quickly before they get to cast the skill. Lastly, Cornuses aren't particularly special, but you must keep in mind that they often cast Reflect Shield, which would reflect your melee damage back to you. Therefore it's best to handle them with Banishing Point instead. The Mystic Horns that they drop can be submitted at the same board for EXP.
</p><p>Alternatively, you can join a 85+ <a href="Halves%27_Royal_Guard_Class_Guide.html#Gramps" title="Halves&#39; Royal Guard Class Guide">Gramps</a> party.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_121_-_145">Level 121 - 145</span></h4>
<p>At this point, your next priority skill to get is Shield Spell Lv1, which boosts your ATK based on your Shield's DEF stat. If you already have a Rosa Shield at this point, this buff will improve your damage potential substantially. Additionally, you may need to start finding better gear than your current Eden Group equipments, as you're closing in on the Endgame.
</p><p>One of the easier ways to do it is by doing <a href="Ghost_Palace.html" title="Ghost Palace">Ghost Palace</a>, which is a Solo instance that rewards you with Gray Shards. These Gray Shards can be traded for Thanatos weapons or Gray equipment set. Doing 2 runs is enough to get you one Weapon or Armor. You can also sell Gray Shards to other players for decent amounts of Zeny. It's important to note that one of the mobs in this instance is Ghost 3 element, so be prepared to use Holy Cross when it is needed.
</p><p>Another option is to do <a href="Airship_Assault.html" title="Airship Assault">Airship Assault</a>, but it is best to do this with a party (or at least, with one healer with you). The Airship Set of Armor, Cloak, and Boots are excellent upgrades to your Eden Group Armor, and can last you well into the endgame in terms of tanking.
</p><p>As for leveling, one of the easier places to level is Rachel Sanctuary. Grab the hunting quest for Vanberk, Isilla, and Hodremlin, as well as the Gathering quest for Will of the Darkness at the 121-130 Board in Eden Group HQ. The 2 humanoid mobs are slow, which makes them easy to hunt. Hunting these mobs also gives you a chance to get <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4413/hodremlin-card">Hodremlin Card</a>, which is one of the best cards for you to use in your Shield slot, as well as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4411">Vanberk Card</a> which is useful for auto-attack Job classes and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4412">Isilla Card</a> which is useful for magic-casting Job classes.
</p><p>At level 131, you can get the hunting quest for One-horn and Two-horn Scarabas at the 131-140 Board. Try to get <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://irowiki.org/wiki/Create_Elemental_Converter">Fire Elemental Converters</a> which are crafted by Sages to gain elemental advantage over these mobs, and make sure to activate Shield Spell Lv1 to maximise your damage. Keep in mind that these mobs have a very high ASPD. Having <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4077/phen-card">Phen Card</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/4327/bloody-butterfly-card">Bloody Butterfly Card</a> on your accessory slot can help you cast Overbrand without interruption. The One-Horn Scarabas also drops <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/1433/imperial-spear-1">Imperial Spears</a>, which are one of the best weapons to use as an RG.
</p><p>It's important to level all the way to 145 rather than 140 with these strategy, so that past this point, you will able to share EXP with level 175 characters.
</p><p>You're also able to level through this stage with a party using <a href="Halves%27_Royal_Guard_Class_Guide.html#Gramps" title="Halves&#39; Royal Guard Class Guide">Gramps</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_146_-_175">Level 146 - 175</span></h4>
<p>When you reach such a high level, most of your Leveling options will be tied to having a party. You will also need to start farming for your Endgame gears.
</p><p>Two very important <a href="Instances.html" title="Instances">Instances</a> to start doing when you're level 145+ is <a href="Temporal_Boots.html" title="Temporal Boots">Old Glast Heim</a> and <a href="Faceworm_Skins.html" title="Faceworm Skins">Faceworm's Nest</a>. These two instances rewards you with your Best-in-Slot armor, footgear, and garments. You can also do other instances such as <a href="Endless_Tower.html" title="Endless Tower">Endless Tower</a> or Endless Cellar, which potentially rewards you with huge amounts of EXP from the MVP kills. At this point, you can start using the gameplay strategy listed above with a Party.
</p><p><a href="Eden_Group.html#Board_Quests" title="Eden Group"> Eden Group Board Quests</a> are still useful at this point. The Hunting quests listed under Bifrost Forest and Bifrost Tower are arguably the easiest, and can be Soloed with minimum difficulty. Make sure to check the Gathering quests to get extra EXP rewards from your hunt.
</p><p>You may also choose to do <a href="Halves%27_Royal_Guard_Class_Guide.html#Gramps" title="Halves&#39; Royal Guard Class Guide">Gramps</a>, Solo (if you're capable) or with a party.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gramps">Gramps</span></h3>
<p><a href="Leveling_Guide.html#Gramps" title="Leveling Guide">Gramps</a> is a special, party oriented dungeon and quest in which you are required to kill 400 of two types of monsters in a special map. Party leaders will often shout through the in-game #lfg channel or open chatrooms in Eden Group HQ to advertise that they are recruiting. To join and participate in this quest, simply talk to the Board NPC in Eden Group to take the quest, join a recruiting party (or even create your own), and enter the map by talking to the Gramps NPC.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_3">Strategy</span></h4>
<p>Gramps is a party-oriented circumstance, which means it is important for you to understand your position in a party.
</p><p>As a Crusader or Paladin, you will most likely be taking the role of Lurer/Tank and Clean-up. Your job is to move ahead and pull in crowds of monsters for your AoE damager to kill, as well as using Holy Cross and Magnum Break occasionally to clean up leftover monsters that did not die in the initial AoE. <i>Do not take a supportive role at this stage. You will find yourself disappointed.</i>
</p><p>As a Royal Guard, you will have a versatility that other classes don't. In the 85-114 range, Overbrand Lv5 can easily flatten entire crowds of monsters in one hit, even when you're only using a Lance or Eden Group Spear. Therefore, you might find yourself to be a valuable AoE for your party, while also being able to Lure, Tank, and Clean-up.
</p><p>In the 115-144 range, it may not be possible to one-shot certain enemies like Scarabas and Observations (when they are in rotation) with Overbrand, but you will still be an excellent Lurer. Make sure you have a shield so you can cast your defensive self buffs (mainly Auto Guard) to help you survive luring and tanking. Try to get the skill King's Grace as soon as possible, and use it in critical moments when you're just about to die to stay alive and allow your party to catch up and kill the mob. If you do it right, you might begin to see how you can play your RG as a never-dying tank.
</p><p>Additionally, if you've learned the skill Shield Spell Lv1 at this point, you should be able to do a good job as an AoE with Overbrand, especially if you have a high-DEF shield like Rosa Shield.
</p><p>In the 145-175 range, as previously mentioned, you should already be doing <a href="Old_Glast_Heim.html" title="Old Glast Heim">Old Glast Heim</a> to start building towards your Temporal Boots. A Temporal Boots of STR would do wonders for your damage at this stage, and if the current rotation of monsters consist of 2 monsters with the same element, using an elemental converter to gain advantage may allow you to one-shot them with Overbrand, therefore opening a possibility to Solo Gramps.
</p><p>If you are playing with a party, however, the strategy remain the same. Use your self buffs and run ahead, luring as many monsters as you can, and pull them towards your party to be killed. Practice using King's Grace at the right moment to stay alive, and wreak havoc with Overbrand whenever possible. With these simple strategies, you should be able to carry your party through a smooth Gramps run, provided you have a good healer and a decent AoE to complement your damage.
