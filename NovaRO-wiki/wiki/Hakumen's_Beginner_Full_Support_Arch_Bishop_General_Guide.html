<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p> Good day and thank you for visiting this page.
</p><p>I created this guide due to my desire to share the knowledge and experience I gained playing as an Arch Bishop for the very first time in this game, with help of various Wiki articles as well as people from the #support channel in-game and some of my friends in-game too.
</p><p>I'm also hoping that through this guide, I can help out newcomers/returning players to the class so that they won't get hated or scolded by their party members due to poor execution of skills and techniques, at least in Gramps leveling/hunting quests, particularly.
</p><p>I also want to help the newcomers/returning players as well by giving them (hopefully) useful ideas, strategies, techniques, tips and tricks that will be able to help them during their time leveling up; from starting out, up to Gramps, and up until tackling more difficult in-game contents in the future, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Instances.html">Instances</a>, as well as giving them useful links to various Ragnarok-related articles online that might prove helpful for them.
</p><p><br />
<b>Furthermore:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Most of my experience came from adapting the Full Support Arch Bishop Role on Gramps Hunting/Leveling Parties at Eden Group (@go eden).</li>
<li>Thus, this guide <b>will mostly focus in being the Full Support AB at Gramps.</b></li>
<li>The reason is that, personally, I feel that <b>Gramps Leveling Parties are one of the best areas</b> a BEGINNER Full Support Arch Bishop will be able to practice their skills with.</li>
<li>Also since, most of the time, Gramps leveling parties mostly run with 10 members to a maximum of 12 (otherwise the party will have a really slow Hunting Quest progress).</li>
<li>Such number is quite enough to simulate a full 12/12 party run on an Instance. Thus, Beginner Full Support ABs can use Gramps Leveling Areas to form parties and practice their skills in a safer manner.</li>
<li>But rest assured I made sure that the information you'll gain here can still serve you as you tackle contents way past Gramps leveling; hence the title includes the words: "<b>Beginner</b>" and "<b>General Guide</b>".</li></ul>
<p><b>A bit more about me:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Even though I've been playing Ragnarok Online for more than a decade now, on and off, do note that I only have about 2-3 weeks worth of experience on playing as an Arch Bishop in Ragnarok Online (in this Server, nonetheless).</li>
<li>I only started to play in this server around late October 2018, so my knowledge is still at its infancy compared to the more advanced users of this class, thus I apologize for any misconceptions/errors I may have here and there.</li>
<li>I'm no expert or authority when it comes to this class (although at the very least, I have some experience and early intermediate level of skill in terms of support role in MOBA (<em>Multiplayer online battle arena) </em>types of games).</li>
<li>But even so, it is my <u>hope</u> that with the information in this guide, <u>you'll be able to gain basic knowledge, tips and tricks that I myself gained from this experience</u> and that it can aid you as a Full Support Arch Bishop in being able to tackle the easy to progressively difficult in-game contents in the future.</li>
<li>And rest assured that I still did my best to gain as much knowledge as possible from researching Wiki pages and from other advanced users of this class.</li>
<li>I also tried my best to make this guide newbie-friendly and as easy to read as I can possibly can (I'm a fellow newbie for this class as well, after all).</li></ul>
<p><b>P.S.: </b>
</p>
<ul><li>You should be able to see a <u>good overview of this guide by checking the table of contents</u> of this page so you can see, at a glance, the type of information that I'm going to share with you.</li>
<li>I structured it that way (with the few main parts of the guide being in the last part) because I feel that <u>you should know important information first before charging to the battlefield</u>.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preliminary_Information">Preliminary Information</span></h2>
<p>I recommend that you <b>read</b> these parts as well <u>to dispel some of the misunderstandings and confusions that might arise as you read this guide</u>. And in addition, an <u>extra introduction about the Arch Bishop class</u> with the recent changes and <u>updates to their Skill Tree</u> as of this writing.

<ul><li>Thus, half, if not most, of the information you'll see here will apply on <b>Gramps Leveling Parties at Eden Group (@go eden).</b></li></ul>
<ul><li>Some parts of this guide also assumes that the Priest Job Class Branch is <b>NOT</b> <b>your first very character</b> in this server, otherwise, you'll find a lot of difficulty in terms of <u>equipment and supplies that you'll need as an AB,</u> due to not having a character that can farm zeny for you efficiently and effectively in the<b> beginning phases</b>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I also highly recommend reading this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Zeny_Guide_and_Farming_101.html">Zeny Guide and Farming 101 article</a> (it's a good idea to read all of it too) to give you some ideas on how to earn Zeny in this game.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Still, due to the "<b>General</b>" property of this guide, I did my best to ensure that you'll still find valuable information that you can use <u>even if you're not doing the Gramps quest at Eden Group</u>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I also hope that this guide will provide you a good set of "<u>stepping stones</u>" for when you finally become the Full/Tank Support AB on parties that are tackling other, more advanced in-game content.</li></ul></div> </div>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<p>With the advent of new Arch Bishop skills such as, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/5073">Convenio</a> , the Arch Bishop's role (and responsibility) as Support in the party became even more dynamic, these responsibilities are:
</p>
<ul><li>Leader of the Party (you HAVE to be the party leader to use Convenio).</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Healer and supplier of buffs for the party as well as debuffing the enemy.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Keeping the party together</b> and picking up any one who strays away from the group (if they're not the Lurer/Tank); a capability which is made possible by Convenio.</li></ul>
<ul><li>By extension, they can also act as a Tank with the aid of their own buff skills, along with <b>Safety Wall spamming</b> (what they call "Turbo Safety Wall") activated manually or with the help of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="NovaExt.html#Enabling_Turbo.2FSmart_Casting">NovaExt extension from the NovaRO patcher</a> ("NovaExt Settings" can be found on bottom right icons in the Nova RO patcher).</li></ul>
<p>This guide, as a result, will focus more on the AB's role as the<b> Party Leader</b>, the <b>utilization of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/26/teleport">Teleport</a>/<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/item/601/fly-wing">Fly Wing</a> plus Convenio </b>to keep the party together and the one, along with the Lurer/Tank who controls where the rest of the party will go, directing the whole party on a spot of the Gramps map where most mobs reside.
</p><p>In any case, being able to practice some of these skills in Gramps parties can become a good starting point to master most of your skills and strategies when the time finally comes for you to become the Full Support AB on parties at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Instances.html">Instances</a>.
</p>
Sloppy supporting and healing techniques and strategies, most of the time, <b>aren't acceptable </b>at the advanced gameplay demands of these game contents (especially the more difficult ones), so while you're still leveling in Gramps quests, I highly suggest you start practicing good habits, movements and techniques starting from there.</div></div>

Lastly, I'd like to express my gratitude as well from the help, guidance and advice I learned and received from <u>Reno's AB Guides</u>, along with <u>Arch Bishop Phillip</u>, <u>people in #support</u>, <u>Wiki Contributors</u>, and <u>some of my friends in-game</u> and of course, researching information made less difficult by <u>Google</u>, as several of the information in this guide is <u>thanks to the information I learned from them all</u>.</div></div>
<p><br />
That's it for the introductions and preliminary information; it is my hope that newbie players for this class will learn something useful from the information I'll share in terms of playing this class; at the very least, on Gramps leveling parties, <u>and from there, refine their skills and techniques even more</u> so that they may become better and capable enough to support a whole party in Instance runs and other difficult in-game content.

<p>This leveling method didn't require me to buy any SP/HP restoration consumables, except Concentration Potions, due to my utilization of @go &lt;preferred town&gt; command and each town spawn point's <b>Healer NPC</b> as substitute for HP and SP restoration consumables.
</p>
<ol><li>Following Nova RO Wiki's Leveling Guide above.</li>
<li>Create Acolyte up to Priest Job Class using the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Priest#Battle_Priest">Battle Priest Build (Strength)</a>
<ul><li>You can use my personal Skill Build for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Images/6/64/Battle_Priest_Build.html">Battle Priest</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Images/2/25/Battle_High_Priest.html">Battle High Priest</a></li>
<li>Editing Macros to provide easy transport and utilization of town's <b>Healer NPC</b>.</li>
<li>How I edited my Macro: Esc &gt; BM/Shortcut Settings &gt; Macro Tab &gt; Change any of the "alt+" macros into the <b>Right Click Button</b> (it will appear as "<b>App</b>" in-game) on my keyboard (<b>usually near the <u>right</u> CTRL button </b>of most Keyboards) &gt; click ok &gt; alt+M &gt; put: @go &lt;insert town of preference&gt; beside the key you changed.</li>
<li>Now if you're <b>low on HP and/or SP</b>, just <b>press the "App" button</b> in your keyboard and you'll get transported immediately to the town of your choice.</li>
<li>From there, use the Healer NPC to replenish your HP and SP, then use Warper NPC again to transport you to the map specified in your current Eden Quest.</li>
<li><u>Rinse and repeat</u> this as you progress in your Eden Group Equipment Quest.</li></ul></li>
<li>Allowing <b>@autoloot</b> command always activated and selling the loots to NPC whenever I go back to town (so I can buy Blue Gems and/or Concentration Potion).</li>
<li>Buff yourself with <b>Increase Agility,</b> <b>Blessing</b> and perhaps <b>level 4 Angelus,</b> can also add<b> Impositio Manus</b>, and <u>just use normal auto-attacks</u> on your enemies. Use <b>Heal</b> skill when needed or <b>Teleport</b> skill to escape.</li>
<li>Go through the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests">very start of Eden Group's Equipment Quest</a></li>
<li><b>Steps to easily and quickly finish</b> the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Eden_Group_Equipments_Quests#Level_60_-_69"><b>Level 60-69 part</b></a> of the Eden Quest:
<ul><li>It will be easier if you <b>use one of your already-max leveled character to hunt for the materials</b> <u>7 Sharp Leaf</u> (@alootid +7100) and <u>5 Shoulder Protectors</u> (@alootid +7196).</li>
<li>The <b>Dryads</b> that drop the Sharp Leaves are just in that map (<b>Lukuka Forest: um_fild01</b>) where the NPC is, once you're outside the Comodo Beach Dungeon for the last part of this Level 60-69 quest.</li>
<li>However it's way faster to hunt the <b>Wootan Fighters</b> that drops the Shoulder Protectors on <b>Hoomga Forest: um_fild02</b> (the entrance is at the East Portal of um_fild01 map), where they're more abundant and can thus save you more time.</li>
<li>After hunting those items with your max-leveled character, just put the items on the Kafra Storage and have your Priest get them or utilize Dual Login and just trade those 5 Shoulder Protectors and 7 Sharp Leaves to your Priest, then talk to the NPC and <b>you'll automatically pass the test</b>.</li></ul></li>

<li>Before you start doing Gramps quest as a Priest: <b>reset your stats and skills</b> first into the Full-Support build; you can use my suggested Full Support <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Hakumen%27s_Beginner_Full_Support_Arch_Bishop_General_Guide.html#The_Stats_Build">Stats Build</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Hakumen%27s_Beginner_Full_Support_Arch_Bishop_General_Guide.html#The_Skill_Build">Skill Build</a> in this guide.</li>
<li>On the part when it says "Turn in both Gramps and hit 99/69 immediately.":
<ul><li>Allocate your stats and skills, the same ones you used as <b>Battle Priest (Strength)</b></li>
<li>Go to Eden Group Building's 2nd floor</li>
<li>Click on the 91-99 Mission Board (near the stairs from whence you came)</li>
<li>Select "Rachel/Veins"</li>
<li>Proceed to hunt 30 Siromas (they are more easily accessible and are not aggressive)</li>
<li>Go to Ice Dungeon (Warper NPC &gt; Dungeons &gt; Ice Dungeon)</li>
<li>Complete the hunting quest, utilizing your "App" button to return to town quickly once you get low on HP/SP, and going back to the dungeon to hunt Siromas again using auto-attacks enhanced by your own buffs, until quest completion.</li>
<li>Check the level 91-99 Mission Board again and <u>Turn-In</u> the hunting quest and you should become level 99/70 at this point.</li>
<li>After reaching level 99/70, <b>reset both of your stats and skills</b> through Reset Man at Main Office (type command: @navi npc_in 110, 29)</li>
<li>Then start following the Stats and Skill Build I'll recommend after this section.</li></ul></li>
<li>Continue following the Nova RO's Leveling Guide, doing Banquet of Heroes story quests as mentioned in the leveling guide, and continue doing Gramps quest while practicing your skills and techniques as Full Support AB with the help of this guide.</li></ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Stats_Build">The Stats Build</span></h2>
<p>This is the Stat Build that I've used when I was still leveling my Arch Bishop in Gramps; I prioritized being able to <u>survive</u> and even <u>tank</u> (<b>high VIT</b>) as well as being able to <u>quickly cast my skills</u> (<b>high DEX</b>), since in Gramps parties (and I think even in other parties at some Instances), the party is <u>always on the move</u>.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<p><b>From level 99/70 High Priest </b>(<b>NOTE:</b> These stats are approximates only, with the help of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://calc.irowiki.org/newcalc/">iRO Wiki's Renewal Stat Calculator</a>)<b>:</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>90</b> points on <b>DEX</b></li>
<li><b>70 </b>points on <b>INT</b></li>
<li><b>50 </b>points on <b>AGI</b></li>
<li><b>50</b> points on <b>VIT</b></li>
<li>Put any leftover points to <b>DEX</b> and <b>save</b> the points (because the goal is to get to 100 points of DEX immediately).</li></ul>
<p>After becoming Arch-Bishop, this is the <b>suggested</b> <b>Stat Build to aim for as you level:</b>
</p>
<ul><li><b>100 </b>points on: <b>VIT, INT, DEX</b></li>
<li><b>90 </b>points on: <b>AGI </b>(with Increase Agility/Canto Candidus Buff, you'll get a total of 100, if not more, AGI stat points)</li>
<li><b>Prioritize: </b>100 points on <b>DEX </b><u>first</u>, followed by <b>INT,</b> then <b>VIT,</b> and work towards 90 points on <b>AGI </b>last.</li>
<li>This is built in a way that can provide you with resistances, even immunity on most status ailments in the game as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Stats">discussed in other articles</a>.</li></ul>
<p><b>Suggested</b> <b>Final Stat Build:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>After achieving 100 points on Vit, Int and Dex, and 90 points on Agi, you can press forward to achieving <b>120 points</b> on <b>TWO </b>of these stats (except perhaps Agi); it's up to you on what to raise up to 120 points, but I recommend achieving 120 points on both <b>Vit and Dex</b> (for Temporal Boots of Vit and Dex bonuses), for the purposes of being able to <b>Switch Gear (alt+D)</b> between <u>Fast-Cast Full Support Mode</u> to <u>Tanking Mode</u>.</li>
<li>Thus, the final base (without bonuses) stat-build at max level is:
<ul><li>120 <b>VIT </b>and <b>DEX</b></li>
<li>100 <b>INT</b></li>
<li>90 <b>AGI</b></li>
<li>1 <b>LUK</b></li>
<li>2 <b>STR</b></li></ul></li>
<li>You can always adjust these stats based on what you deem necessary; especially once you've finished your Gramps leveling phase.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Skill_Build">The Skill Build</span></h2>
<p>These are the Skill Builds I utilized when I was still leveling in Gramps, and I also am planning to use these builds as well even if I'm already running Instances with my AB.
</p><p>As of now I haven't tested the efficiency of these Skill Builds outside of Gramps since I'm still farming Zeny and building my AB's Tank-Support Equipment as of this writing.
</p><p>You may have to adapt yours according to the situation once you're tackling a variety of Instances (it pays to read up guides on the Instance you want to tackle beforehand), but for our purposes and from my experience, <u>these skill builds will serve you well in your time at Gramps leveling</u>, as well as, hopefully, even if you're already running Instances with various party members as well in the future.
</p><p>I will only summarize some of the skills that I think you will need in Gramps parties, which may or may not be useful when you're already running a variety of Instances.
</p><p>Thus, if you want even more information about the rest of the skills for this particular Job Class Branch, as well as additional information from the ones I explained here, you can find the information on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Reno%27s_Full_Support_Arch_Bishop_Guide-2.html#Skills">Reno's Full Support Arch Bishop Guide (Skills section)</a>.

<ul><li><u>Maxing out</u> the essential buffs (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/29/increase-agility">Increase Agility</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/34/blessing">Blessing</a>) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/28/heal">Heal</a> <u>will improve the potency</u> of your advanced Skills as an AB later on.</li>
<li>From my experience, you'll barely have to use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/30/decrease-agility">Decrease AGI</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Signum_Crusis">Signum Crusis</a> (and on some degree, even the skills <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Ruwach">Ruwach</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Warp_Portal">Warp Portal</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Pneuma">Pneuma</a>) <u>in Gramps runs</u>.</li>
<li>Putting <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Angelus">Angelus</a> at <u>level 2 is the minimum</u> to unlock <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Kyrie_Eleison">Kyrie Eleison</a> which is a prerequisite to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2045/praefatio">Praefatio</a>.</li>
<li>But you can still level Angelus <u>up to level 4</u> like in this build for a bit of versatility.</li>
<li>It is <u>possible to raise Angelus to level 10</u> by sacrificing 1 point in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Teleport">Teleport</a>, and not adding points on Warp Portal and Pneuma; but I wouldn't recommend increasing Angelus' level further than 4 (citing the 3rd point above).</li>
<li>(<b>NOTE: </b>The 5th point above only applies on Gramps runs; <b>Pneuma</b> is a very useful/even necessary skill on Instances and other contents outside of Gramps, and <b>Warp Portal</b> can allow you to save Warp Points (using <b>/memo</b>) on some areas/maps that the Warper NPC exclusive to Nova RO Server <u>might not be able to transport you to</u>).</li></ul>

<ul><li>Skills <u>I haven't unlocked</u> in this build are <u>virtually useless</u> in Gramps runs as a Full Support AB, Priest/ess or High Priest/ess; don't bother with those skills.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/66/impositio-manus">Impositio Manus</a></b> is a good buff to give towards <u>Physical Damage Dealer allies</u>, but it <u>gives all your skills a cooldown</u> after use (also called a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#Cast_Delay">"Global Skill Cooldown"/"Global Skill Delay"</a>) which can be <u>quite an annoyance in some situations</u>.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/361/assumptio">Assumptio</a> </b>is a really good skill to give to either yourself or to your <u>Tank/Lurer allies</u>, or even those with <u>squishy defenses</u> to help them survive.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/73/kyrie-eleison">Kyrie Eleison</a></b> gives anyone you give it to a barrier that prevents damage, this means you can also use this <u>to protect yourself</u>, or any other <u>allies that cast skills</u> (like Mage classes) <u>from being interrupted in their skill casting</u>.</li>
<li>Kyrie Eleison is sufficient enough at level 8; its Praefatio version (even at level 5) <u>can block more attacks</u> than level 10 Kyrie Eleison would; giving you two more points to max <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Impositio_Manus">Impositio Manus</a>, which the damage dealers in your party <u>will definitely appreciate</u>.</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/74/magnificat">Magnificat</a></b> is <b>a very important skill to max</b>; you and your party members need all the <u>SP REGENERATION BOOSTS</u><b> </b>available to them.</li>
<li>Maxing out <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Resurrection"><b>Resurrection</b></a> (more powerful "Heal" in a sense, on a downed ally) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Meditatio"><b>Meditation Passive</b></a> (increase SP Recovery) can help you a lot as Full Support AB role.</li>
<li>Platinum Skill: <b>Redemptio</b>: This is basically a free-skill (no stat points needed), and it <b>revives multiple members</b> of your party at ONCE.
<ul><li>The Cast Time is 4 Seconds and <b> naturally cannot be interrupted</b> by any attacks, nor hastened by any skills or equipment.</li>
<li>You can use this in emergencies and if you need to revive more than one party members at once.</li>
<li>Take note that you'll be <b>very vulnerable</b> once you finish casting this skill; thus prepare your HP/SP restoration consumables.</li>
<li>You might also want to protect yourself with Kyrie Eleison and Safety Wall first before casting the skill if there are enemies around.</li>
<li>If you <b>cannot see this skill unlocked</b> in your Skill Tree Window; go to Main Office in Prontera and talk to <b>Platinum Skill NPC</b> (@navi npc_in 123, 40).</li>
<li>For more information about the skill, visit this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Redemptio">iRO Wiki Page</a></li></ul></li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/12/safety-wall">Safety Wall</a>&#160;: </b>Maxing out this skill is also <b>very important</b> especially once you utilize a technique called "Turbo-Safety Wall" and in being able to keep <b>yourself</b> and your <b>allies</b> safe from <b>Melee Physical damage</b>. As this skill's level increases, the <b>cast time becomes significantly shorter.</b></li>
<li>You can sacrifice points from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Assumptio"><b>Assumptio</b></a> (it's mostly over-written by Praefatio/Kyrie Eleison anyway) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Lex_Aeterna"><b>Lex Aeterna</b></a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/5072"><b>Vituperatum</b></a> is an AoE Lex Aeterna; more useful for Gramps maps vs Mobs, albeit this one has a cast time and consumes Blue Gemstones unlike its single target counterpart).
<ul><li>The above can be done to raise <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Sanctuary"><b>Sanctuary</b></a> to <b>level 7</b>(which reaches its <u>max healing value</u> starting from that level), though from my experience <u>I hardly ever used Sanctuary</u> (and even Arch Bishop's <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2044/epiclesis">Epiclesis</a></b> for that matter) since in Gramps, the team is <u>always on the move</u>; rarely sitting still as the mobs are cleared almost immediately.</li></ul></li>
<li>However, the main advantage of <b>Assumptio </b>is that it <b>doesn't</b> <b>expire prematurely</b> unlike Kyrie Eleison/Praefatio which expires prematurely once it already finished blocking a certain number of hits.
<ul><li>Thus you can also choose to <u>buff your Tank/Lurer with level 5 Assumptio instead</u>; which is the reason why Assumptio is level 5 in this example build.</li></ul></li></ul>

<li>Standing on a cell occupied by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/25/pneuma"><b>Pneuma</b></a><b></b></li>
<li>Standing on a cell occupied by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/288/magnetic-earth"><b>Land Protector/Magnetic Earth</b></a><b></b></li>
<li>You can activate <b>/m2e</b> command to easily see where some of these skills' occupied cells are.</li>
<li>As of now, the <b>only ways you can prevent cast interruption</b> while casting Convenio in a mobby area is to use Kyrie Eleison on yourself/Praefatio or equipment with a Coyote Card, Phen Card, or Ancient Decoration of Rift + Ancient Armor of Rift Equipment Combo.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>After unlocking Convenio</b>: You must unlock and max out <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2515/sacrament">Sacrament</a></b> skill <b>IMMEDIATELY, </b>since this is the buff you yourself will definitely need to <u>further increase the casting speed of your skills</u> even with Eden Group Equips at 100 Base DEX stats; you can--and should-- also give this buff to <u>other allies that mostly casts skills</u> such as <u>Job Classes originating from the Mage/Magician branch</u>, or even other Job Classes who has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Skills#Cast_Time">Cast Times</a> on their <u>most-used skills</u>.</li>
<li>Once you've unlocked those essential skills I mentioned above, feel free to level up the other skills that I suggested on this build in whatever order you feel is necessary.</li>
<li><b>NOTE:</b> It's <u>NOT recommended to aim at unlocking Convenio at Job Level 15</u> (the earliest you can unlock it), since the <u>AoE Increase Agility</u> and <u>Blessing</u> are two of the most immediate buffs your party will need. It's also not advisable to leave Clementia and Canto Candidus at level 1 while you get Convenio ASAP because their skill range at that level is very limited to benefit most of your party members. Unlocking Convenio at <u>Job Level 22 is still a better course of action</u>.</li>
<li><b>PLEASE: Don't waste skill points on Judex and Adoramus, your role is Full Support, NOT DPS/AoE Damage Dealer! </b>And this particular strategy is designed for ABs who have little to no funding at all.</li>
<li>You can only double as Support and Damage Dealer for the party if you are <b>WEALTHY</b> enough to have sufficient equipment to make it work! (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Reno%27s_Exorcist_Arch_Bishop_Guide-2.html">More at Reno's Exorcist AB Guide</a>)</li>
<li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/2053/expiatio">Expiatio</a></b> is a good buff to give your <u>Physical AND Magical Damage Dealer allies</u> as well (with the new update, as of this writing, it now pierces <b>BOTH</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>AND</b> <b>Magical Defense</b>), so you can use this in combination with Odin's Power and Impositio Manus (Impositio Manus is more useful for Physical Damage Dealers though).
<ul><li><b>NOTE:</b> Despite the description of Expiatio adding "Holy Power", it <b>DOESN'T</b> actually add Holy <b>Element</b> to your weapon (the one that does this is Aspersio instead). The "Holy Power" part is just there for decoration, a flavor-text.</li></ul></li>
<li>If <u>chaining</u> these three skills, a recommended sequence will be: <u>Odin's Power &gt; Expiatio &gt; Impositio Manus</u> (this has to be last due to it causing a Global Cooldown on your skills).</li>
<li>You can use <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.divine-pride.net/database/skill/5011/offertorium">Offertorium</a></b> <b>AFTER </b>casting Sanctuary (to conserve SP), to boost its healing power. (Credits to Reno's AB Guide)</li>
<li>You can <u>deactivate</u> the effects of Offertorium by <u>using Magnificat</u> skill and vice-versa. (Credits to Reno's AB Guide)</li>
<li>Likewise, you can also use <u>Offertorium</u> to temporarily boost the power of your <u>Heal/High Heal</u>, <u>Sanctuary</u> or <u>Coluceo Heal</u>, if for some reason you find one or many members of your party having less than half of their HP.</li>
<li>Level 1 <u>Offertorium</u> combined with one or two Coluceo Heals are <u>mostly enough to restore your party's HP to near max/full</u>, and sometimes Offertorium + <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/High_Heal">Highness Heal</a> might be necessary to be used on Tanks/Lurers. Afterwards just cancel this skill immediately by using Magnificat.</li>
<li><u>Don't bother and waste SP</u> on healing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Madogear#Limitations">Mechanics that are using Madogear</a>&#160;; your heals and some of your buffs won't work as explained in the article I linked.</li>
<li>Max out <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Sacrament">Sacrament</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Coluseo_Heal">Coluceo Heal</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Clementia">Clementia</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Cantocandidus">Canto Candidus</a> as <u>these skills are the ones your party needs the most regardless of their Job Class</u> (and <b>YOU</b> need to maintain constant Sacrament buff too along with other allies that casts skills).</li>
<li><b>Praefatio at level 5</b> is more than <u>sufficient</u> for supporting your party in Gramps runs; it also has less cooldown than if it's on level 10, <u>allowing you to use it more frequently</u>.</li>
<li>Remember you can always use Kyrie Eleison to <u>refresh the barrier</u> granted by Praefatio on your party members .</li>
<li>You can use Epiclesis from time to time if your team is having SP problems; though most of the time, the party is always on the move, thus maintaining Magnificat always active is the better course of action.</li>
<li><b>Ancilla</b>: This will be the Skill (and the Item it produces from your Blue Gemstones) that will be one of <b>your ultimate and most reliable means of SP restoration</b> through a technique I call "Ancilla Cycle" (more on this later on the Chapter 8 of this guide).
<ul><li>In addition, Ancilla also boosts your <b>Healing Power</b> and <b>SP Recovery</b>; this skill is a <b>must-get</b> and a <b>must-use</b>!</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Clearance</b>: Make sure to read the skill information correctly; this skill will only <u>remove buffs and debuffs</u> <b>on yourself, your party members and normal, non-MvP boss enemies</b>, don't waste time and SP using this skill on players that are <b>NOT in your party</b> or Enemy players in WoE/PvP.
<ul><li>For a list and information of the Buffs and Debuffs cleared by this skill, see this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Clearance">iRO Wiki Article</a> and this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/topic/1343-archbishop-clearance/?tab=comments#comment-7114">Forum Page</a> (credits on Reno's Full Support Arch Bishop Guide).</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Useful_Commands">Useful Commands</span></h2>
<p>These are some of the commands that you can use to make your job as Full Support Arch Bishop more convenient.
</p><p>A full list of these commands along with their respective effects are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Player_Commands.html">in this article</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="NovaExt.html">this one too for NovaExt</a> (a built-in extension system with your Nova RO game app).
</p><p>The ones I'll list here are the ones that you'll likely be using the most, in Gramps parties or maybe even in some Instances.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li><b>@noshare</b>: Prevents the party's auto-looted shared loots from getting in your inventory; you must <u>avoid getting overweight</u> because it will interfere with your SP regeneration; using SP restoration items is not recommended especially as a new player due to the amount of possible Zeny sink this might cause, plus, you have your Ancilla skill to solve your SP problems (more on this later).</li>
<li><b>/snap</b>: If this is OFF, your cursor won't snap and stick to any enemies. Sometimes you REALLY have to turn this off in order for your to place Safety Wall on your own character especially if you are surrounded by mobs.</li>
<li><b>/skillsnap</b>: You may have turned off <b>/snap</b>, but with <b>/skillsnap</b> on, you're still in DANGER of your cursor sticking to a monster instead of your own tile since this particular Mouse Cursor Snap <b>activates while you're using a targeted skill</b>.</li>
<li><b>/itemsnap</b>: Turn this <b>OFF</b> to prevent your cursor from automatically sticking to the <b>items scattered on the ground</b> which can also mess up with your Safety Wall aim.
<ul><li>So to use your Turbo Safety Wall effectively and <b>accurately</b>, you must <b>TURN-OFF BOTH /snap, /skillsnap and /itemsnap.</b></li>
<li>Now's probably a good time as well to <u>get used to targeting monsters with your Auto-Attacks or Skills without relying on these two Mouse Cursor Snaps</u>.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>@noks</b>: This prevents other people/parties from being able to hit the enemies that you and your party is currently attacking/being attacked with.</li>
<li><b>@nopickup</b>: This can help prevent you from (accidentally) picking up items that dropped on the floor when you should be moving there to heal/buff someone instead.</li>
<li><b>/fpsunlock</b>: Can help making your Nova RO game client to run smoother graphically; allowing you smoother transition between movements so you can do your job even better as a Support, especially during very busy/chaotic situations.</li>
<li><b>/fps</b>: Displays your current FPS and Vsync. Used to check the effects of <b>/fpsunlock</b></li>
<li>/<b>box</b>: If enemies enter this boxed area, you'll get detected by them.
<ul><li>It also <u>displays the relative maximum distance of the casting range of both Pneuma and Safety Wall</u> (and, as mentioned by Arch Bishop Phillip in other parts of this webpage, it also seems to be <u>the range wherein you're able to give your allies the targeted heals and buffs</u> like Expiatio, Odin's Power, Impositio Manus, and Sacrament among others) from where you're standing, without having to make your character move from their spot.</li>
<li>I did try it out myself and indeed; <b>most</b>, if not all of your <b>targeted heals, buffs, debuffs and skills</b> can be cast inside this boxed area (or at the very least, near the <u>BORDERS</u> of this box), without having your character move from their place.</li>
<li>Thus you can also <b>use this command to help you gauge your distance</b> while assisting your allies if you're debuffing enemies with your Odin's Power (to reduce their DEF and MDEF), and Lex Aeterna/Vituperatum, or buffing/healing your allies in a relatively safe distance without having to walk into/near them.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>/m2e</b>: Highlights the tile on which AoE skills have an effect. Useful to seeing the area of effect of skills such as Pneuma and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Safety_Wall">Safety Wall</a></li>
<li><b>/circle3</b>: This displays the range of your AoE buff skills; only party members inside this circle will get affected by your AoE buffs (i.e. Magnificat, Canto Candidus, Clementia, Praefatio).</li>
<li><b>@showbuffs</b>:<b> </b>Useful in keeping track of some (NOT all) of your buffs on your teammates (visible on your alt+z window and in Party UI boxes).</li>
<li><b>/dead</b>: Highlights dead cells (un-traversible cells) in black. Useful for traversing around unfamiliar maps.</li>
<li><b>@hold 1</b>: Prevents your character from (accidentally) moving while spamming targeted buffs and heals on your allies. Recommended to put this command in your in-game Macro Settings (Esc&gt;BM/Shortcut Settings&gt;"Macros" tab&gt;Change one of the keys to one you don't use the most like the <b>`</b>(or <b>~</b>) key).
<ul><li><b>NOTE:</b> You have to type something else after pressing the modified macro for <u>2-4 times</u> otherwise <u>the game will block you</u> from using the macro key, thinking that you're spamming a message 3 times; if you get stuck in the Hold position, you/your allies might get in danger, so you better <u>prevent the game from blocking your access to @hold 1 command</u>.</li>
<li>A quick way to prevent the system from blocking your command is to type something, such as the punctuation and symbol keys near your Enter key, example:
<ul><li>Press Enter <b>once</b></li>
<li>Type one symbol like <b>\</b> or <b>] </b>or<b>&#160;;</b></li>
<li>Press Enter <b>twice</b></li>
<li>Then you can prevent the system from blocking you from using the Macro'd <b>@hold 1</b> command for another 4-5 presses.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>@showsp:</b> This <u>displays the SP</u> of your allies <u>instead of their HP</u>. Though this is more useful for Scholars/Sorcerers with their <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Soul_Exhale">Soul Exhale/Soul Change</a> skill, you can also utilize this to check if anyone in your team needs SP restoration (especially the damage dealers); if that is the case, <u>you can use that as a cue to use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Epiclesis">Epiclesis</a> to help them replenish SP</u>.</li>
<li><b>/turbo</b> (or press the Pause - Break button in keyboard, usually near Scroll Lock): Used to toggle Turbo Mode/Smart Casting on and off; a feature of NovaExt built-in with your NovaRO Game App (more on this later).</li></ul>

<p>These are some of the in-game tools that you can <u>utilize</u> to make your job as Full Support <b>more convenient and less stressful</b>. These helped me a lot, and I feel that these will help you a lot, as well.

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li>With this method, you can make another tab in your chat window that will display only the ones you want for it to display.</li>
<li>This is useful in keeping track of what your teammates will say during the run without it getting flooded by extraneous system messages.</li>
<li>To begin, <b>click the + sign</b> on the top right corner of your chat window:</li>
<li><div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:205px;"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(1).html" class="image"><img alt="Chat Window Filtering (1).jpg" src="../w/images/2/27/Chat_Window_Filtering_(1).html" decoding="async" width="203" height="183" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(1).html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li></ul>
<ul><li>A new tab will appear. It might appear separated on your default chat window, if that's the case, drag it from its top part down to the main party window so that they'll merge. You might have to click the <u>padlock button to OPEN</u> first before you can drag the new window down.<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:220px;"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(2).html" class="image"><img alt="Chat Window Filtering (2).jpg" src="../w/images/6/6a/Chat_Window_Filtering_(2).html" decoding="async" width="218" height="185" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(2).html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li></ul>
<ul><li>After dragging the new window down and merging it with the main chat window, click the <u>padlock button close again so that you don't accidentally move it away</u>. Afterwards, click this <b>circle button</b> beside <b>&gt;&gt;</b>:<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:197px;"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(3).html" class="image"><img alt="Chat Window Filtering (3).jpg" src="../w/images/b/bd/Chat_Window_Filtering_(3).html" decoding="async" width="195" height="183" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(3).html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li></ul>
<ul><li>These are what I recommend for you to keep in ON mode.<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(4).html" class="image"><img alt="Chat Window Filtering (4).jpg" src="../w/images/8/89/Chat_Window_Filtering_(4).html" decoding="async" width="300" height="176" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(4).html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li></ul>
<ul><li>I also recommend activating these (as mentioned by Arch Bishop Phillip, Party Member's Abnormal Status Message can display if Odin's Power is already expired on your allies).</li>
<li>Also, the <u>Party Configuration Message Display</u> which displays if the Party's Settings on EXP sharing is on <b>Even Share</b> or <b>Each Take</b>. Always check your party's settings through alt+P and make sure the<b> "How to Share EXP" </b>is in<b> "Even Share"</b>, <u>never forget this or else your party will hate you</u>. You also won't be able to obtain EXP during Gramps runs yourself because you're not hitting enemies.<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(5).html" class="image"><img alt="Chat Window Filtering (5).jpg" src="../w/images/9/91/Chat_Window_Filtering_(5).html" decoding="async" width="300" height="173" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Chat_Window_Filtering_(5).html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>NOTE: </b>Setting <u>Party Member's Abnormal Status Message</u> to <b>ON </b>might (and actually, WILL) flood your supposedly "Chat Only" tab, which can bury any messages, important or not, from your party members; if this proved to be an annoyance (and it <b>MIGHT</b> be), just leave it to <b>OFF</b> (I actually have mine at OFF as well), since, once again, you can always keep track of your Odin's Power/Impositio Manus/Expiatio durations using Lauda Ramus/Agnus and Angelus lv.4-lv.5 respectively.</li>
<li>From here on out, whenever you're in a party, always switch to this tab during Gramps quest sessions or in other in-game content, to allow you to easily see the messages and communicate with your party members.</li></ul></div></div>

<ul><li>As you may see from above, I've rearranged the black boxes according to their roles/Job Classes (easily identifiable by the<b> Job Class Icon</b> beside their in-game name), putting the ones that needs the most buff (i.e. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Expiatio">Expiatio</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Odin%27s_Power">Odin's Power</a>, Sacrament) on top, and those who mostly needs healing at the bottom.

<li><b>NOTE:</b> Using targeted buffs/heals on your allies using the Party UI will cause will character to walk up to them until they are in range. <u>But sometimes that won't usually work</u>, especially if the ally in question is quite far away from you; what will happen is that your character will stagger and won't know what to do and just stop moving instead of using its skills on your ally.

<p>In order to utilize the NovaExt's Turbo Mode and Smart Casting to enable you to use a technique called "Turbo-Safety Wall" you must first do some configurations:
</p>
<ul><li>Memorize on which button in your keyboard did you put your Safety Wall skill.</li>
<li>Open Nova RO Patcher (will need to exit the game first).</li>
<li>Click the the third bottom-leftmost Icon on the patcher ("NovaExt Settings"):</li></ul>
<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="File_NovaExt_settings_1.html" class="image"><img alt="NovaExt settings 1.png" src="../w/images/2/28/NovaExt_settings_1.html" decoding="async" width="300" height="213" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_NovaExt_settings_1.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div>

<ul><li>Click the key which corresponds to where you put the Safety Wall skill in-game (in my case it's Number 2).</li>
<li>Then just <u>adjust the slider according to the function you want</u> for it to be <u>based on the instructions in this new window</u> that appeared.</li>
<li>For Turbo-Safety Wall, you'll want to put its button on the <b>"Smart Cast"</b> mode.
<ul><li>Self/Party Buffs <u>without</u> a targeting cursor such as Clementia and Canto Candidus or even <b>CONSUMABLES</b> can be <u>spammed</u> using the <b>"Turbo"</b> mode.</li></ul></li>
<li>I recommend <b>UNCHECKING</b> the "Enable Turbo Hotkeys" so that it's <u>OFF by Default</u> and won't interfere while logging in-game.
<ul><li>Though you can still turn this mode ON/OFF even in Login Screen through the "Pause - Break" button in your keyboard.</li></ul></li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> then <b>Close</b> then login in-game.</li></ul>
<ul><li>To turn this Turbo/Smart Cast mode ON/OFF in-game, just press the <b>"Pause - Break"</b> key in your keyboard, usually near the Scroll Lock, or you can type <b>/turbo</b>.</li>
<li>You should see a notification in your Chat Window in-game to see if Turbo Mode is Disabled or Enabled.
<ul><li><b>NOTE:</b> Once again, I highly recommend that you turn OFF <b>/snap</b>, <b>/skillsnap</b> and <b>/itemsnap</b> so that you'll be able to use Turbo Safetywall effectively and ACCURATELY, especially in a mobby area.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Once you've Enabled the Turbo Mode, all you have to do to use the Turbo-Safety Wall technique is to:
</p>
<ul><li>Point your mouse cursor on anywhere you want the Safety Wall spamming to happen.</li>
<li>Then just press AND hold the button of your Safety Wall and it will automatically use the skill AND click repeatedly (hence, "Smart Cast").</li>
<li><u>You don't have to click using your mouse anymore</u>, just point it on a desired cell/target then just hold the Turbo/Smart Cast-Enabled key from your NovaExt Settings and watch the magic happen.</li></ul>

<p>Another useful in-game feature implemented as part of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.novaragnarok.com/forum/news/open-beta-new-client-r202/">Beta-client in Nova RO</a> , this will enable you to change multiple parts of your equipment AT ONCE without having to double click them from your inventory or put them in your Hotkey Slots.
</p><p>Thus making it possible to <b>quickly transition</b> between, for example, having an equipment that is geared for <b>Full Support-mode</b> to immediately transitioning towards equipment that's geared for <b>Tanking-mode.</b>
</p><p>Remember that this action has <b>10 seconds cooldown.</b>
</p><p>There are some configurations you must do first:
</p>
<ul><li>Open your Equipment and Inventory Windows (Alt+Q and Alt+E).</li>
<li>Click "Swap Equip" on your Equipment Window.</li></ul>
<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:602px;"><a href="File_Gear_Swapping_1.html" class="image"><img alt="Gear Swapping 1.jpg" src="../w/images/b/bf/Gear_Swapping_1.html" decoding="async" width="600" height="359" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Gear_Swapping_1.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div>
<ul><li>On the <u>extended Equipment Window</u> that appears right under, <b>drag and drop</b> the 2nd set of equipment you wish to use.</li>
<li>They will then have two red arrows in them in your Inventory Window as seen from these screenshots (I already set mine so it's already like that).</li></ul>
<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:602px;"><a href="File_Gear_Swapping_2.html" class="image"><img alt="Gear Swapping 2.jpg" src="../w/images/e/e3/Gear_Swapping_2.html" decoding="async" width="600" height="359" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Gear_Swapping_2.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>Once you're done placing your desired 2nd set of equipment on the "Swap Equip" extended window:
</p>
<ul><li>Just click the "<b>Change</b>" button or simply press the shortcut keys <b>Alt+D</b> to activate "Swap Gear".</li></ul>
<div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:602px;"><a href="File_Gear_Swapping_3.html" class="image"><img alt="Gear Swapping 3.jpg" src="../w/images/0/06/Gear_Swapping_3.html" decoding="async" width="600" height="359" class="thumbimage" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Gear_Swapping_3.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div>
<ul><li>You're now equipping the equipment you placed on the Swap Equip extended window from earlier.</li>
<li>To transition back to previous equipment set, just click <b>"Change" </b>again or just use the <b>Alt+D</b> shortcut keys (will only work once the <b>10 Seconds Cooldown</b> is over).</li>
<li>Take note that <b>if you double click any</b> of the equipment in your inventory that has those <b>two red arrows</b>, they will be <b>removed</b> from the Swap Equip Window.</li>
<li><u>Losing those two red arrows</u> on a piece of equipment will make it become <b>excluded</b> from the gears that will be swapped when you use the Swap Gear function.</li></ul>

<p>As already mentioned on other parts of this webpage, you can solve this problem by utilizing the <b>Ancilla skill and item</b>.

</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h4>

<li>If multiple damage dealers are in the party, you might have to <u>use the Lauda skills first</u> before applying the Odin's Power and/or Impositio Manus buff to them; so you can replenish the buff immediately before it expires.</li>
<li>In some situations, you have to apply Odin's Power buff on some mini-boss/bosses (MvP) enemies as well to weaken their Physical AND Magical Defense; but do so at your own risk as sometimes their attacks can get way too powerful.

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<p>This can be solved by:

<ul><li>Use <b>Offertorium</b>, at least level 1 and using Highness/Coluceo Heal a few times, followed by Praefatio/Kyrie Eleison and then deactivating Offertorium buff with Magnificat.</li>
<li><b>Teleport somewhere</b> and use Convenio there, following up with Praefatio and Coluceo Heal once they appeared.</li>
<li><b>Let the ones getting mobbed die</b> so that the mobs will transfer targets (make sure it's <u>NOT gonna be you!</u>), then revive these downed allies; with max leveled Resurrection at level 4, you can immediately replenish their HP to almost full (thus, kind of "Healing" them more effectively in just one skill rather than a Heal skill spam).
<ul><li>If a situation arose that you're the only one left standing, you can still tank those mods while using the time to revive your damage dealer characters.</li>
<li>You can do so by using <b>Kyrie Eleison</b> on yourself in <b>combination with Safety Wall</b>. You don't have to use Turbo Safety Wall; just use the skill <b>once</b>, then immediately revive your Damage Dealer ally.</li>
<li>For judging the <b>range of the Resurrection skill</b>, wherein you can use it without having to move from your spot, it seems you can also rely on the <b>/box</b> command; thus as long as the damage dealer is inside the highlighted box, you can Resurrect them without moving (I actually haven't tried this yet, my apologies).</li>
<li>After reviving your Damage Dealer ally; <b>IMMEDIATELY </b>utilize Turbo Safety Wall on yourself.</li></ul></li>
<li>Then reapply the usual Kyrie, then Agi, Bless buff to them.</li>
<li>As a side note: <u>Those who are downed can still increase their Quest Kill Counts</u> as long as the carnage happened <u>within their field of vision</u>, so don't worry and don't panic about reviving them right away; prioritize your Damage Dealer allies after yourself.</li></ul>

<p>The main part of the guide. This is where the information I've been giving you so far from the previous sections will come together and be put to use. This is more or less a guideline of sorts, that personally served me well when I was still leveling at Gramps.
</p><p>This section deals with the processes as well as <u>notes on good habits and mindset you must practice and have</u> as a Full Support Arch Bishop. This <u>mostly applies on Gramps quest</u>, though <b>some of these can also apply on other in-game content</b> as well such as <b>Instances</b>.

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li>BEFORE the run starts, if an AB is not the leader, ask them to transfer the position to an AB with Convenio (such as you, if you unlocked the skill already); as <b>only the Party Leader</b> <b>AB</b> can use Convenio.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Before you go inside Gramps map or as your party slots are being filled, <b>utilize the new Party UI</b>: alt+z &gt; right click on the name &gt; click add to UI &gt; repeat until you see everyone's names on the side of your screen &gt; click and drag the Names Boxes to arrange them in two columns. (See "Useful In-game tools to utilize" section of this guide).</li></ul>
<ul><li>ALWAYS CHECK AND <b>RECHECK your Party's Configuration settings</b> using alt+P and check if the <b>"How to Share EXP"</b> is in <b>"Even Share"</b>, your whole party, including you, needs to have shared EXP in Gramps Leveling quests or else your leveling progress will be very slow (and your party members will surely get angry).</li></ul>
<ul><li>It's also a good idea to set the <b>"How to Share Items"</b> to <b>"Party Share"</b> and <b>"Item Sharing Type"</b> to <b>"Shared"</b> to prevent your Damage-Dealer allies from getting overweight quickly (assuming they don't activate <b>@noshare </b>while having <b>@autoloot</b> activated).</li></ul>
<ul><li>You can activate <b>@showbuffs</b> if you wish to determine if your allies are currently under effect of various buffs like Increase Agility and Blessing. Useful to check who among your members wasn’t able to get reached by the AoE range of Clementia and Canto Candidus.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If there are very people who are entering your Chat Room i.e. "LFM&gt; 85+ Gramps 3/12" and finding a party member is taking too long, use the #lfg channel in-game and type that you are looking for members in Gramps quest on the level 85(-114) Range
<ul><li>You can also include phrases like "we have AB"; most of the time this works to increasing the chances (and amount) of possible members joining your party.</li></ul></li></ul>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li><b>Priority FOUR </b>(or Six)<b> BUFFS</b> should be maintained:
<ul><li><b>Clementia</b></li>
<li><b>Canto Candidus</b></li>
<li><b>Praefatio</b> (<b>refresh</b> the barrier using <b>Kyrie Eleison on Lurer/Tank </b>or you can just use Lv. 5 <b>Assumptio</b> on them)</li>
<li><b>MAGNIFICAT</b></li>
<li>You can also include <b>Angelus</b> in this lineup, as it can still help with increasing party's defense after all, especially once their Kyrie Eleison/Praefatio barriers have expired.</li>
<li><b>Sacrament</b>: Once you're high-level enough to unlock this skill, you must also <u>ALWAYS maintain yourself buffed with this skill</u>, along with other Skill-Casters in your party (like the Mage Classes).</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>If you notice your Magnificat, AND other <b>buff icons is</b> <b>turning half into color ORANGE</b>, use Magnificat and those other buffs again immediately. <b>ALWAYS MAINTAIN YOUR BUFFS ACTIVE, </b>especially the <b>Four (or Six) Buffs</b> I mentioned above<b>.</b></li></ul>
<ul><li>Make it a habit only to <b>reapply specific buffs</b> once the <u>buff icon turns at least half-orange</u>
<ul><li>Spamming the same buffs in quick, successive manner even if they're still far from being expired is not the very SP efficient thing to do; <b>give your SP the time it needs to regenerate.</b></li></ul></li></ul>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li><b>Make it a habit</b> to look at these places frequently:
<ul><li><b>At the Party UI: </b>to see who needs <u>healing</u> (and their buffs if you activated <b>@showbuffs</b>)</li>
<li><b>The Buff icons on your screen:</b> to see <u>which buffs need refreshing/keeping track of Odin's Power, Impositio Manus, and Expiatio's timers</u> (through Lauda Ramus/Lauda Agnus and Increase Agility/Blessing respectively).</li>
<li><b>The Mini-map:</b> to see <u>who's straying too far from the group</u> (if there is, this is when you use Convenio<b>, </b><u>with some exceptions</u> if that member is the lurer/tank that is searching for mobs, which brings us to the next step).</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Keep your party members <b>within the Circle</b> if you activated the <b>/circle 3</b> command to ensure that they will get affected by your AoE buffs.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you notice someone's <b>HP/Icon is</b> <b>grayed out</b> in the Party UI, open alt+z party window and <b>check if they're offline</b>, if they are <b>online</b>, it means they're far away from the group or is in need of Resurrection skill (also pay attention to your chat window, in the tab that you customized that I showed you on the "In-game tools to utilize" section).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Once again, maintain for yourself <b>and</b> any Mage/Minstrel/Wanderer/Skill Caster-type character in your party the <b>level 5 Sacrament</b> buff for <u>faster cast time</u>.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Use your own timer of Sacrament.</b> Develop a habit of: if you buff yourself with it, be sure to buff the other members who needs it ASAP as well. Or you can see this as <b>$ sign</b> beside your ally's name if you activated <b>@showbuffs</b>.</li></ul>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li><b>ALWAYS catch up to the Lurer/Tank</b>, so after they gather the mobs, <u>use Convenio to grab your party immediately near the mobs</u> even if AT LEAST ONE of them are far away.
<ul><li>Remember <u>you must gather all your party members to the scene as much as possible</u> so that their kill counts will increase and no mobs (and time) are wasted.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Don't leave/Teleport</b> and Convenio somewhere else <b>too abruptly;</b> you must wait until your party is already or nearly done wiping out the mobs in the area before moving on.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Use Convenio <b>if someone's far away</b> from the group while those ahead is killing the mobs; so before they kill off the mobs, use Convenio to make your other party members catch up on kill counts.</li></ul>
<ul><li>While you are casting Convenio, <b>check your Buff Icons </b>to see if any buffs needs refreshing; if there is, take note of that and be prepared to cast it immediately after casting Convenio.
<ul><li><b>Reapply the almost-expiring buffs IMMEDIATELY</b> after using Convenio while your party members are still within your screen because some of them love TO GET THE HELL AWAY FROM YOU immediately after Convenio.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Most of the time, the ones I cast after using Convenio is <b>Praefatio</b> (if it's not on cooldown) and/<b>or Coluseo heal</b>.
<ul><li>For some reason, <u>you will take a lot of damage</u> in a mobby area after casting Convenio as all of the enemies' attacks are<b> concentrated on you</b>; so take note of this and <u>be ready to heal yourself</u> (using <b>Highness Heal </b>on yourself will be effective in this case).</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>If there is <b>ANOTHER PARTY NEARBY</b>, Kyrie Eleison yourself (if this buff is already expired on your character), then use <b>Teleport</b>.
<ul><li>Don't be picky with the place as long as it's far enough from the other party<b> and Convenio immediately</b>.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>If mobs are thin</b> when you Teleported, use Teleport again and look for a mobby area, then use Convenio there.
<ul><li>Or just follow the Lurer/Tank and you two might be able to find a mobby area nearby.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>If the mobs are thinning</b> as you and your party members are traversing the map, use Kyrie Eleison on yourself, use <b>Teleport</b> and <u>look for a decently/overly mobby area</u> then use Convenio there.
<ul><li>This is the moment where you shine as one of the <u>"Pseudo-Lurers/Mob-Finders"</u> in the party.</li></ul></li></ul>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li>It is possible for you to act as a Tank for parties.</li>
<li>Equipment that make you have more HP (as well as having UNINTERRUPTIBLE Skill Casting) will help you during Tanking-mode.</li>
<li>For Tanking/Luring equipment reference, you can check them on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Arch_Bishop.html#Equipment">General Arch Bishop page</a> (along with a few more tips and tricks from other contributors).</li>
<li>You also need to utilize the skills: Kyrie Eleison/Praefatio, Assumptio, Pneuma and Safety Wall, all <b>depending on the Situation, you may even have to use Sanctuary and/or Epiclesis if the situation calls for it</b>.</li>
<li>Another method of tanking is through the use of the technique called "Turbo-Safety Wall", utilizing NovaExt configurations, which was discussed earlier on the "Useful In-game Tools to Utilize" part.</li>
<li>That technique allows you to spam Safety Wall over and over; no worries because spamming the skill over and over on a tile that <b>already has</b> Safety Wall/Pneuma on it <b>WON'T CONSUME</b> any SP and Blue Gemstones; it will only consume those once Safety Wall's casting is successful.</li>
<li>You can use this technique to tank <b>Melee Attacks</b> from enemies, if you're tanking <b>Ranged Attacks</b>, use <b>Pneuma</b> instead.</li>
<li>Note that you can also use those techniques on your <b>allies instead</b>, and on your <b>tank</b>, too, thus keeping them safe and your tank, being more tankier.</li>
<li>However, you can't use Safety Wall if the cell is occupied by a Land Protector/Magnetic Earth skill, or it's a Dead Cell (un-walkable cell).</li>
<li>And once again, it's highly recommended to turn off <b>/snap </b>, <b>/skillsnap</b> and <b>/itemsnap</b> so you can use Turbo Safety Wall, or just manual Safety Wall spamming with greater Accuracy.</li>
<li>You can also use this technique in conjunction with the command <b>/box </b>so you have a guide to see how far you can use Safety Wall <b>WITHOUT</b> moving from your spot.</li>
<li>In combination with above; you can also use <b>@hold 1</b> (or press the Macro Key that you modified; I was able to discuss the full mechanics and precautions on the earlier parts of the guide as well at "Useful Commands" part) so you can spam/rapid-fire any of your Targeted-Buffs and heals <b>without worry</b> of moving <b>accidentally</b> to your demise or missing your allies.</li></ul>

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"> <b>Click "Expand" to show contents-----&gt;</b> <div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<ul><li>From time to time/if you can spare some SP and Blue Gemstones, you can utilize<b> Vituperatum</b> (the AoE Lex Aeterna) on the mobs if your party's damage-dealers cannot reliably wipe out the mobs immediately.</li>
<li>If you and your party are fighting a powerful enemy instead like an MvP Boss enemy, use <b>Lex Aeterna</b> instead (especially if your damage dealers can kill off the MvP's slaves easily) since it's more spammable, no cast time and no Blue Gemstone cost.</li>
<li>Another Skill Combination that you can try in most situation:
<ul><li>Use the <b>Aspersio</b> buff on your Physical damage dealers.</li>
<li>Afterwards, use <b>Oratio</b>, at least level 5 (<b>65%</b> success rate, <b>10%</b> Holy Resistance Reduction) to weaken the Holy Element Resistance of all the enemies on your screen.</li>
<li>This will allow your damage dealer allies to deal even more damage.</li>
<li>This will work, as far as I know, on a lot of enemies, as long as their Element <b>IS NOT HOLY</b>.</li>
<li>You might find some more use for this on the High Turn-In (TI) quest of Gramps (145+), since sometimes, damage dealer allies requires around <b>2-3 AoE skills to clear a mob</b> especially if they're under-geared/under-leveled, and even on <b>MvP Boss</b> enemies that are <b>naturally weak and will take more damage </b>to the Holy Element.</li></ul></li></ul>
